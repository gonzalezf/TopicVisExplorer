Their citizenship was revoked by using the excuse that this\\npeople have stayed out of Greece for too long. They are Greek citizens\\nand are residing in Greece, even one of them is actively serving in\\nthe Greek army. Besides, other non-Turkish citizens of Greece are\\nnot subject to this kind of interpretation at an extent that many of\\nGreek-Americans have Greek citizenship and they permanently live in\\nthe United States.\"\\n\\n\"We want guarantee for Turkish minority\\'s equal rights. We want Greek\\ngovernment to accept the Turkish minority and grant us our civil rights.\\nOur people are waiting since 25 years to get driving licenses. The Greek\\ngovernment is not granting building permits to Turks for renovating\\nour buildings or building new ones. If your name is Turkish, you are\\nnot hired to the government offices.\"\\n\\n\"Furthermore, we want Greek government to give us equal opportunity\\nin business. They do not grant licenses so we can participate in the\\neconomic life of Greece. In my case, they denied me a medical license\\nnecessary for practicing surgery in Greek hospitals despite the fact\\nthat I have finished a Greek medical school and followed all the\\nnecessary steps in my career.\"\\n\\n\"We want freedom of expression for ethnic Turks. We are not allowed\\nto call ourselves Turks. I myself have been subject of a number of\\nlaw suits and even have been imprisoned just because I called myself\\na Turk.\"\\n\\n\"We also want Greek government to provide freedom of religion.\"\\n\\nIn separate interview with The Turkish Times, Dr. Sadik Ahmet stated\\nthat the conditions of ethnic Turks are deplorable and in the eyes of\\nGreek laws, ethnic Greeks are more equal than ethnic Turks. As an example,\\nhe said there are about 20,000 telephone subscribers in Selanik (Thessaloniki)\\nand only about 800 of them are Turks. That is not because Turks do not\\nwant to have telephone services at their home and businesses. He said\\nthat Greek government changed the election law just to keep him out\\nof the parliament as an independent representative and they stated\\nthis fact openly to him. While there is no minimum qualification\\nrequirement for parties in terms of receiving at least 3% of the votes,\\nthey imposed this requirement for the independent parties, including\\nthe Turkish candidates.\\n\\nAhmet was born in a small village at Gumulcine (Komotini), Greece 1947.\\nHe earned his medical degree at University of Thessaloniki in 1974.\\nhe served in the Greek military as an infantryman.\\n\\nIn 1985 he got involved with community affairs for the first time\\nby collecting 15,000 signatures to protest the unjust implementation\\nof laws against ethnic Turks.

In fact, I was\\ngoing to point to Pasteur as yet another rather common example -- particularly\\nthe studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation.  I will readily\\nconcede that \"ridiculous reasons\" can play an important role in how\\nscientists spend their time.  But one should not confuse motivation with\\nmethodology nor suppose that ridiculous reasons provide the impetus in the\\nmajority of cases based on relatively infrequent anecdotal evidence.\\n-- \\nGary H.

Smith, D.D.\\n                              (1894-1977)\\n\\n          When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about\\n     Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:\\n\\n                 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son\\n               of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief\\n               priests and unto the scribes, and they shall\\n               condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him\\n               to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and\\n               to crucify Him; and the third day He shall\\n               rise again\" (Matthew 20:18-19).\\n\\n          Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,\\n     who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving\\n     reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He\\n     knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious\\n     leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that\\n     one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual\\n     death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly\\n     how He would die--*by crucifixion.*\\n\\n          All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the\\n     minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted\\n     would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise\\n     again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.\\n\\n          But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-\\n     tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-\\n     tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.\\n\\n          The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth\\n     between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and\\n     ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which\\n     had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against\\n     the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had\\n     predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and\\n     on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the\\n     disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some\\n     of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the\\n     tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,\\n     they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back\\n     to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus\\' friends, Peter and\\n     John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the\\n     tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came\\n     hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them\\n     to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).\\n\\n          How did this tomb become empty?\\n\\n          One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--\\n     professor of New Testament literature in a large theological\\n     seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*\\n     the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by\\n     bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb\\n     became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the\\n     chimney at Christmas time.\\n\\n          But he didn\\'t realize that Santa Clause never did come down\\n     any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa\\n     Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the\\n     tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.\\n\\n          Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-\\n     bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by\\n     mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.\\n\\n          Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,\\n     tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar\\n     in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)\\n     that the women went to the wrong tomb.\\n\\n          The facts are these:\\n\\n          First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to\\n     which by mistake they could have gone.\\n\\n          Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or\\n     more people to forget the place where they have buried their\\n     dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women\\n     did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to\\n     the wrong tomb?\\n\\n          Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?\\n\\n          There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the\\n     evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.\\n\\n                  Now when they were going, behold, some\\n               of the watch came into the city and showed\\n               unto the chief priests all the things that\\n               were done.  And when they were assembled\\n               with the leaders and had taken counsel, they\\n               gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,\\n               Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole\\n               Him away while we slept.  And if this come to\\n               the governor\\'s ears, we will persuade him, and\\n               secure you.  So they took the money, and did\\n               as they were taught:  and this saying is com-\\n               monly reported among the Jews until this day\\n               (Matthew 28:11-15).\\n\\n          This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the\\n     fact that the tomb was empty.\\n\\n          You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never\\n     questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to\\n     see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.\\n\\n          Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that\\n     the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus\\' disciples\\n     came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*\\n\\n          How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?\\n     Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.\\n\\n          Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject\\n     the explanation, the very character and the later history of the\\n     disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away\\n     the body of Jesus.\\n\\n          First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in\\n     Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to\\n     contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His\\n     resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there\\n     had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,\\n     then proved.\\n\\n          Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would\\n     have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.\\n     It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most\\n     of these men did.\\n\\n          The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ\\n     had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it\\n     would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed\\n     pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing\\n     humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today\\n     as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.\\n\\n          But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to\\n     leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to\\n     what had happened to Him.\\n\\n          Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.\\n\\n          He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning\\n     (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-\\n     18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He\\n     walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that\\n     night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper\\n     room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).\\n\\n          A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at\\n     the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren\\n     on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the\\n     apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-\\n     8).\\n\\n          As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-\\n     ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed\\n     attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are\\n     unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the\\n     unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the\\n     appearances.\\n\\n          Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our\\n     leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are\\n     antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest\\n     thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.\\n     Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;\\n     Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of\\n     Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president\\n     of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.\\n\\n          But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has\\n     it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:\\n     it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.\\n\\n          Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He\\n     claimed to have come down *from* God.\\n\\n          He said He was the way *to* God.\\n\\n          He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.\\n\\n          He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one\\n     else had it.\\n\\n          He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to\\n     us.\\n\\n          Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed\\n     that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*\\n\\n          Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe\\n     that His words are all true?\\n\\n          The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us\\n     that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?\\n\\n          And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead\\n     testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some\\n     day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.\\n\\n          In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all\\n     this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For\\n     He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-\\n     ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a\\n     hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.\\n\\n          Those who have tried it down through the ages--*and there have been\\n     many*--have given their testimony.  And we today who believe also know.\\n'},\n",

Olson was still\\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\\n\\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\\nand Berryhill couldn\\'t hit their way out of a wet cardboard\\nbox, and don\\'t walk enough to be useful.\\n\\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\\nat the start of the season, he wouldn\\'t have gotten his job back.\\n\\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\\nPlus, you\\'d have to eat that salary, which isn\\'t huge, but isn\\'t\\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson\\'s at about $800,000, Berryhill\\nat $450,000, but that\\'s only what I recall).\\n\\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players\\naren\\'t eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster\\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the\\nfirst time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.\\n\\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn\\'t on the team.\\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\\nand the truth is that I\\'d rather see our best team on the field,\\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\\n\\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won\\'t need him. ;)\\n\\nAs for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\\nlike this:  (Remember, they\\'ve BOTH been GM\\'s)\\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\\n\\nCox:  OK, we\\'ve sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\\nis better than it used to be.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\\njust won\\'t sign that baseball only contract.  We can\\'t count\\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman\\'s not ready to give up on\\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher\\'s gone AND Deion signs,\\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\\n\\nCox:  Yep, that\\'ll be nice.  Too bad Deion won\\'t sign.\\nOK, I\\'ll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\\nKlesko?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ve still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\\nbut somehow he doesn\\'t seem to be the same GM.  First\\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I\\'d HAVE to believe that he\\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\\n\\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I\\'ll wait til the trading\\ndeadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\\nAnd if that doesn\\'t work, then perhaps Sid\\'s knees\\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There\\'s always the\\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\\n\\nCox:  Well, he\\'s not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\\nin Richmond, he\\'ll start walking more.  Besides, if he\\'s going to be\\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Now, let\\'s see.  That leaves Lopez.\\n\\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn\\'t think Olson\\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\\nrunning into him again?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he\\'ll get\\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson\\'s shown his stuff a little\\nbit, I can\\'t trade him.  Besides, Berryhill\\'s a left-handed\\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\\n\\nCox:  Don\\'t you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you\\'re the one who wouldn\\'t write Lopez\\ninto the lineup.\\n\\nCox:  Well, you\\'re the one who went out and got me Jeff\\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn\\'t be used\\nto our pitching staff\\'s stuff.  He got some time with\\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\\nwill be hurt by May.\\n\\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\\nTHE WORLD SERIES!  I\\'ll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey\\nStengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto,\\nbut have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I\\'ll finally\\nget my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those\\n\"happy pills\" left around by Chuck Tanner?  Why\\'d you\\never hire that guy anyhow?\\n\\nCox:  Don\\'t ask me; ask Ted.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nEric Roush\\t\\tfierkelab@\\tbchm.biochem.duke.edu\\n\"I am a Marxist, of the Groucho sort\"\\nGrafitti, Paris, 1968\\n\\nTANSTAAFL!

Or they can be\\nILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon when every other full moon comes around.\\n\\nAs far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do\\nwhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.\\n\\nMaking a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:\\n\\ncommand         response            name\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\nLEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience\\nLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience\\n\\nSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.\\n\\nObedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of\\nthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to\\nconsider someone\\'s compliance or refusal and then say whether they are\\n\"obedient\" or \"disobedient\".  You also have to take into consideration\\nwhether the commands are good or bad.\\n\\nIn my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon, and they all refuse, they aren\\'t being disobedient at all!\\n\\nAs far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly\\nrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that\\nalone is insufficient to allow one to label them \"disobedient\".  You\\nalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.\\n\\nAnd there\\'s the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been\\ncommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of\\ncourse disagreed.\\n\\nSo where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\\nPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\\nway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.\\n\\nThe problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of\\nwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of\\nAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You\\nwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press\\nin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I\\nget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the\\nSociety of Saint Pius X.)\\n\\nMany Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some\\nsoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually\\nsome Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand,\\nthere is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the\\nPopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to\\nhelp the situation by obeying them where they\\'re wrong.  In fact, if\\nthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very\\nleast, they\\'re wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing\\nto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this\\nbadly.\\n\\nSchism... let\\'s move on to schism.  What is it?\\n\\nSchism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\\ncommand).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it\\'s a superset, so\\nit doesn\\'t work the other way around: not all disobeyers are\\nschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don\\'t comply with\\nthe Holy Father\\'s desires doesn\\'t make them schismatics.\\n\\nSo what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a\\nschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.\\n\\nYou must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any\\ndecent reference on Catholic theology, and that\\'s what you\\'ll find:\\nthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to\\ncommand.\\n\\nHere\\'s what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:\\n\\n    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this\\n    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands\\n    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.\\n    (from the CE article \"Schism\")\\n\\nIs the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear\\nno: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every\\nday.  And that\\'s all that matters as far as schism goes.\\n\\nWhat all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the\\nconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position\\nis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and\\nschism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they\\nthink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of\\nthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone\\nwho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)\\n\\nNow, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the\\nHoly Father\\'s motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", you can find out.  It\\'s the\\ndefinitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically\\nPapal act.  It\\'s not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter\\nthat the Pope has possibly never even read.  It\\'s from the Pope\\nhimself.  His boss is God... there\\'s no one else to complain to.\\n\\nIn this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:\\n\\n1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre\\nconstituted a schismatic act.\\n\\n2) Archbishop Lefebvre\\'s problem was a misunderstanding of the nature\\nof Tradtion.\\n\\nBoth are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope\\'s points.\\n\\nAs far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting\\narticle in a translation of the Italian magazine \"Si Si No No\".  It\\nall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal\\nconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope\\'s jurisdiction, then they\\nwould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication\\nunder the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is\\nthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal\\nconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power\\nof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be\\nconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the\\nPope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite\\nwell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over\\nanyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.\\n\\nThe \"Si Si No No\" article was interesting in that it posited that the\\nreason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,\\npost-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea,\\nepiscopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article\\nto a friend, unfortunately, so can\\'t tell you more.  I believe they\\nquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.\\n\\nThe Pope\\'s thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.\\nThere\\'s no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic\\ntheology.  So why does the Pope think this?\\n\\nAs far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here\\'s\\nthe passage in question:\\n\\n    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete\\n    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does\\n    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of\\n    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,\\n\\n        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the\\n        help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into\\n        the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes\\n        about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and\\n        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.\\n        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which\\n        they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who\\n        have received, along with their right of succession in the\\n        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.\\n\\n    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which\\n    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the\\n    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to\\n    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond\\n    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ\\n    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.\\n\\n    (Papal motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", 2 July 1988)\\n\\nIt seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can\\nbe simplified to the following:\\n\\n- Vatican Council II has happened.\\n- I am the Pope.\\n\\nThe argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that\\nArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.\\nThis is weak, to say the least!\\n\\nIt would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed\\nArchbishop Lefebvre\\'s concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II\\'s\\nstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius\\nIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to\\nignore what all these Popes said on the subject?\\n\\nI don\\'t know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the\\nSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey\\n\"justified disobedience\" or even \"obeying God rather than man\".\\nCalling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in\\nWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.\\n\\nSimilarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope\\nsays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it\\nexists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,\\nthat there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will\\nshortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?\\n\\nIt seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing\\nyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it\\ndo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in\\nthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church\\ndiscipline?  It\\'s one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his\\npowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It\\'s something else to\\nsay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is\\nall in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are\\nnot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally\\nit has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.\\nWhile they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they\\nhave admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door\\nto people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly\\nobeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.\\nThis would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command\\nthat you say defines schism.\\n\\n--clh]\\n'},\n",

My\\nmachine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from\\nwhen I called the order in. \\n\\n   Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the \\nperipherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I\\nwas very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway \\ndocumentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals.\\nThe Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came\\nwith build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office)\\nwas properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and \\nhas been performing flawlessly. It\\'s been on all weekend and it hardly\\neven reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a \\nlot to do with it. \\n\\n   It\\'s up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I\\'ve also read about\\nsome people having problems with high speed serial communications. \\nI used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old\\ncomputer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \"maps\" the other\\nmachines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \"cd\" to these\\ndrives and either run programs or copy files. It\\'s almost like a\\npeer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.\\nIt\\'s not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this\\nmachine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the \\npeer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. \\n\\n  My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also\\nby-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430\\ncredit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!\\n\\n  So, I\\'m glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I\\'m glad it\\nwas me.

(To\\n>reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from\\n>uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical\\n>problems are notoriously problematic.)  \\n\\nOkay, so let\\'s see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \\nof certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \\ncontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \\nextent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \\ntreatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even \\nif uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that\\na treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for\\nfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.\\nIn this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible\\nbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are\\nqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.\\n\\nSECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of \\nevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  \\n\\n\\nI come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a\\nmathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and\\noccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much\\nof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as\\ninformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years\\nnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to\\njust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of\\nthe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for\\nthe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the\\nNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from\\nsubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of\\nscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the\\n*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific\\ninvestigation.\\n\\nOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \"If this\\nhasn\\'t been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical\\nresearch then it can\\'t be of any interest to us.\"  \\n\\nTo me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \"There\\'ve got to\\nbe controlled studies\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast\\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.\\n\\nSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world\\'s most \\nimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that \\nit doesn\\'t take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell \\nwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple \\nvisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that\\nit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is\\nuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially\\na variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral\\ntherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once\\n(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The\\nprocess doesn\\'t need to be repeated and the subject doesn\\'t need to\\npractice it over again at home.\\n\\nNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. \\n(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  \\nTake someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up \\nto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 \\nminutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to \\nthe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a \\nfew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term \\nfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view \\neven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, \\nthere are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best \\nof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed \\nafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done\\nwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast \\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th\\nfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  \\n\\nThe folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\\nmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\\nwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \\nmany of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \\nafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \\nthe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they\\'re not part of the\\nscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \\nfrom scientific acceptance.) \\n\\nThe Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical \\npsychology establishment is still saying \"We don\\'t have any way of \\nknowing that it\\'s effective.\"  \\n\\nThese academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate \\nas anyone could want, of course, but they say  \"Why should I prove your \\ntheory?\"  and  \"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\"  \\nOne academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \\nunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn\\'t \\nbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It\\'s described in a number of \\nbooks and I\\'ve posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much \\ndetail as I\\'m capable of.)  \\n\\nActually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with \\nfavorable results), but it\\'s apparently not acceptable because it\\'s a\\ndoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\\n\\nTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  \\nThis is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \"doctrinnaire\" \\nattitudes about science.  \\n\\nNow maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  \\nIf so, I apologize. \\n \\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \\n\\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\\n'},\n",

It is very unlikely, however,\\n   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs\\n\\nNot possible either.  You\\'d need about a 300 amp alternator for\\njust the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow\\ndown on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.\\n\\n   for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt\\n   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet \\n   away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.\\n   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be \\n   caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station\\n   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio \\n   transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,\\n   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are\\n   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.\\n\\n   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite\\n   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably\\n   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can\\n   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).\\n   Good instructions are included with the chokes.\\n   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your\\n   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof\\n   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things\\n   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.\\n\\nAnd please remember to be friendly when approaching your\\nlocal radio operator.  This person may or may not be the \\ncause of your troubles,  and you\\'ll get better cooperation\\nand help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most\\nare).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes\\ndealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost\\npictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.\\ninterferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  \\n\\nBTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or\\nnot he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of\\nbeing a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.\\nToo bad they don\\'t require the consumer equipment makers\\nto take any precautions.\\n\\nLast, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are\\nrequired to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more\\nthan 10).  So if you hear \"This is WA1QT\" or some other call starting\\nwith A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.\\nCB\\'ers probably won\\'t sign (I don\\'t know that they\\'re even required\\nto) and fire/police have other private ids.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\nDouglas S.

They certainly have the right to do so, under\\nthe Second Amendment Right to Bear Arms.\\n\\nIf you are tired of newspapers who run sex and liquor ads galor, yet refuse to\\nrun legitimate gun ads, please send a letter to the editors indicating your\\ndispleasure over their censorship doctrine.\\n\\nFollowing is a list of Bay area newspapers who censor gun ads.

Massive amounts of regolith would\\nhave to be processed.\\n\\nThis thread reminds me of Wingo\\'s claims some time ago about the moon\\nas a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn\\'t\\ncontent with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth\\'s crust,\\naverage) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the\\nmarket price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.\\nThis prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.\\n\\nOn the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; \"high-Ti\" basalts (Apollo 11\\nand 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...\\nterrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in\\ntitanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and\\nsometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are\\n*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the\\nworld (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If\\neven 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2\\nat concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti\\nbasalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon\\ncould be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the\\nore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being\\nmined today).\\n\\n\\tPaul F.

I then went out shopping for\\na new lock for the bicycle.\\n\\nFor about the same money ($20) I had the choice of a Kryptonite cable lock\\n(advantages: lock front and back wheels on bicycle and keep them both,\\nKryptonite name) or a cheesy no-name U-lock (advantages: real steel).\\nI chose the Kryptonite cable.  After less than a week, I took it back in\\ndisgust and exchanged it for the cheesy no-name U-lock.\\n\\nFirst, the Krypto cable I bought is not made by Kryptonite, is not covered by\\nthe Kryptonite guarantee, and doesn\\'t even approach Kryptonite standards of\\nquality and quality assurance.  It is just some generic made-in-Taiwan cable\\nlock with the Kryptonite name on it.\\n\\nSecondly, the latch engagement mechanism is something of a joke.  I\\ndon\\'t know if mine was a particularly poor example, but it was often\\nquite frustrating to get the latch to positively engage, and sometimes\\nit would seem to engage, only to fall open when I went to unlock it.\\n\\nThirdly, the lock has a little plastic door on the keyway which serves\\nthe sole purpose of frustrating any attempt to insert the key in the \\ndark.  I didn\\'t try it (obviously), but I have my doubts that the \\nlock mechanism would stand up to an \"insert screwdriver and TORQUE\"\\nattack.\\n\\nFourthly, the cable was not, in my opinion, of sufficient thickness to \\ndeter theft (for my piece of crap bicycle, that is).  All cables suffer the\\nweakness that they can be cut a few strands at a time.  If you are patient\\nyou can cut cables with fingernail clippers.

No cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look \\nvery clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. All \\nstill within factory specs. The only thing I could find, however, was a \\nslightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), \\nbut it is still way below the wear-limit given in the Clymer-manual for \\nthis bike. \\nAny syggestions??? What else could cause my problem??? Do I have to hone \\nthe cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in \\norder to get better breaking in of my new rings??? Won't that increase the \\nwear of my pistons??\\nPlease send comments to \\n\\tsruhl@mechanical.watstar.uwaterloo.ca\\nThanks in advance. Stef. \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \\nStefan Ruhl \\ngerman exchange student. \\nDon't poke into my privacy ! \\n\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"From: hedrick@cs.rutgers.edu\\nSubject: Re: Doing the work of God??!!)\\nLines: 59\\n\\nDesiree Bradley (Desiree_Bradley@mindlink.bc.ca) asked us whether we\\nshould think of the Serbs as doing God's work in Bosnia.  I've\\nrefrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with\\nthe OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say\\nsomething.\\n\\nMany things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest\\nsuggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the\\nGospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death\\nof Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break\\ndown these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there\\nis neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If\\nMoslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill\\nthem.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions.\\nThere are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under\\nattack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are\\nliving together peacefully.\\n\\nThe precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two\\ndifferent things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into\\nCanaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have\\npromised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be\\na holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those\\nattacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be\\ndefeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in\\nJoshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was\\npossible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once\\nthat was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were\\nexpected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of\\nagreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted\\nBosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior\\nwould have disqualified this from being a holy war.\\n\\nThe other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by\\nAssyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel\\nfor her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a\\njudgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay\\nof the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because\\nillness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God\\nfor good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't\\njustify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that\\nin attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as\\n*unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's\\npeople, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were\\nactually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action.\\nFurthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are\\njudgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through\\nhis prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to\\nBosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting,\\nI am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that\\ndoesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from\\njudgement.\\n\\nI am particularly concerned about the implications of this issue\\nbecause of current tensions between the West and Moslem-oriented\\nnations.  What we do not need is for Moslems to conclude that\\nChristians think it's OK to kill Moslems.  The implications for the\\nmid-East, and even relations with American Moslems, could be quite\\nserious.\\n\"},\n",

Well,\\nthink again.  Sometimes the only real support out there is what Apple\\ncomputer users can give to each other.  For another example, read on:\\n\\nIn the March 15th issue of _MacWeek_, Ric Ford described a two-year effort\\nby Liam Breck to document and bring to Apple\\'s attention a problem with\\ncertain defective mice.  At random, the switches on these mice \"stick\" in\\nthe down position until clicked a second time, apparently regardless of the\\nmachine they are used with or the system software involved. Most of the\\nreported problem mice were manufactured in Malaysia and have an FCC ID of\\nBCGA65431. You\\'ll recognize this \"sticky button\" symptom immediately if you\\nhave such a mouse: the problem is intermittent, but it\\'s not subtle.\\n\\nLiam Breck recently gave up trying to document this problem, and instead \\nsuggested that people contact Apple\\'s Customer Assistance Center directly\\n(_MacWeek_ 4/5/93 p. 64). When I called Apple on March 23rd and described\\nmy defective mouse, I was eventually given a case number (F83Y) and told\\nApple would replace this mouse even though it is a few months out of\\nwarranty.  After waiting for three weeks, I called back today wondering\\nwhere my new mouse was. This time, I was told that Apple had decided the\\nserial number on my mouse (MB13831FC25) is not within the (undisclosed)\\nrange Apple is willing to replace, and there is nothing I can do about it.\\n\\nNothing, that is, unless enough people complain about this problem to make\\nit worth Apple\\'s while to fix or replace the entire lot of defective mice.\\nPlease, if you have one of these mice, I NEED YOUR HELP! Don\\'t assume you\\nknow what causes the problem (there are _lots_ of theories) and start\\nhacking around inside your hundred-dollar mouse. Instead, let Apple do it.\\nPlease take five minutes to CALL APPLE RIGHT NOW at:\\n\\n                  United States      1-800-776-2333\\n                  Canada             800-665-2775\\n                  UK and Europe      33-1-49-01-49-01\\n                  Australia          61-2-452-8000\\n                  Japan and Pacific  81-3-5411-8500\\n\\nIf the number isn\\'t toll-free, call collect.  Describe the problem and ask\\nfor a replacement mouse.  Even if they refuse, insist that they register\\nthe details of your case, including your mouse\\'s serial number.  Be firm.\\n\\nNetwork managers and user-group leaders especially, please query your user\\nbases. Everyone ask your friends and colleagues.  Please don\\'t send mail to\\nme or post yet another \"sticky-button\" report, CALL APPLE DIRECTLY!  If\\nenough victims take the trouble to report this well-known problem, Apple\\nwill eventually be forced to respond.  If Apple continues to find it easy\\nto stone-wall on this issue, don\\'t expect them to offer support when the\\nnext, potentially more serious Mac defect is uncovered.\\n\\n-- Bill Sloan\\n'},\n",

I used some string to tie the pack together\\nwhile holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go\\nto get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.\\n\\nGetting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too...\\nuntil I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.\\n\\nOne the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential\\ntilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right\\nhole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling\\nforward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an\\nhour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block\\nwith levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a \\nbreak and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD\\nbeen lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must \\nhave ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move \\nit back... hmmm...).\\n\\nAfter that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.\\n\\nBTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for.\\nAt least it now sits level..\\n\\n-- \\n\\nE.

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test\\nand a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were\\nperformed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter\\nantenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis\\nis in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed\\ninformation relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.\\n\\n3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)\\nadvanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone\\n70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees\\nto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.\\n\\n5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change\\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance\\nmeasurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC\\nmeasurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and\\ncurrently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with\\nthe model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.\\n\\n6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 184 hours\\n\\n\\nTRAJECTORY\\n\\n     As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\\nstatus was as follows:\\n\\n\\tDistance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU)\\n\\tDistance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU)\\n\\tHeliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour\\n\\tDistance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km\\n\\tRound Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds\\n\\n\\nSPECIAL TOPIC\\n\\n1.  As of April 22, 1993, a total of 70185 real-time commands have been\\ntransmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65077  were initiated in the\\nsequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process.\\nIn the past week, one real time command was transmitted: one was initiated in\\nthe sequence design process and none initiated in the real time command\\nprocess.

My definition\\nis this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids\\nmistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous\\nwork.  Lee Lady writes:\\n\\n> I don\\'t think that science should be defined in a way that some \\n> of the activities that lead to really important science --- namely\\n> thinking and informal exploration --- are not recognized as\\n> scientific work.  \\n\\nUnless one classifies \"thinking and informal exploration\" as a\\nmistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would\\nconsider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as\\nunscientific.  \\n\\nIn article <C5nAsF.MH7@news.Hawaii.Edu> lady@uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu (Lee Lady) writes:\\n> Seriously, I\\'m not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.  \\n> I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science \\n> is mainly about avoiding mistakes. ...\\n\\nHere is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not\\nclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be\\ntaken as describing what \"science is mainly about.\"  Consider,\\nfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking\\na backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and\\nwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what\\ninvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and\\nstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,\\nthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that\\nsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are\\nubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the\\ndefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are\\n\"mainly about.\"\\n\\nThe misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient\\ncontext for people to understand my proposed definition.\\n\\n> Okay, so let\\'s see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \\n> of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \\n> controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \\n> extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \\n> treatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even \\n> if uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that\\n> a treatment is useful. ...\\n>\\n> SECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of \\n> evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  \\n\\nI agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only\\ntake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians\\nthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  \\n\\nAs to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about\\n\"absolute scientific truth.\"  I think it is more useful to talk\\nabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the\\nkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have\\nproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of\\ndegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the\\nrelevance of different kinds of evidence.  \\n\\nOne of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as\\npsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion\\nregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,\\nthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the\\nhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence\\nare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to\\nspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that\\nspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to\\nidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence\\nwas presently available for them, and to describe how research\\ncould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to\\nuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper\\nof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the\\nauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It\\nis in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)\\n\\n> The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\\n> make this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\\n> will be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \\n> many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \\n> afford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \\n> the whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they\\'re not part of the\\n> scientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \\n> from scientific acceptance.) \\n\\nI think a lot of scientists steer away from things that --\\ndeserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When\\nproponents of some practice see no value in more careful\\ninvestigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many\\nresearchers\\' minds.  \\n\\nThis is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some\\nintersection between things that are worth investigating and\\nthings that are advocated by those who seem careless or\\nunreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can\\nunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select other\\ndirections for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one\\nwants to become this generation\\'s Rhine.\\n\\n> One academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \\n> unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn\\'t \\n> been described in a scientific journal. ...\\n\\nI think this is absurd.  \\n\\n> Actually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done \\n> (with favorable results), but it\\'s apparently not acceptable because\\n> it\\'s a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\\n\\nI wonder why the results were not published.  In my field,\\ndissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are\\nsubmitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for\\npublication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly\\neases one\\'s defense.)\\n\\nFinally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either\\non NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.  I know little\\nabout either and so have nothing to offer.\\n\\nRussell\\n'},\n",

       "  'content': 'From: betz@gozer.idbsu.edu (Andrew Betz)\\nSubject: Randy Weaver trial update: Day 4.\\nNntp-Posting-Host: gozer\\nOrganization: SigSauer Fan Club \\nLines: 87\\n\\nNote: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the\\n_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television\\nstation, KTVB Channel 7.\\n\\nRandy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4.\\n\\nFriday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.\\n\\nSynopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent\\nCooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald\\nHowen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\\n\\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\\nthe government\\'s only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\\nSpence attacked Cooper\\'s credibility by pointing out discrepancies\\nbetween Cooper\\'s statements last September and those made in court.\\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\\na few seconds...It\\'s difficult to remember what went on first.\"\\n\\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver\\'s dog.\\n\\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan\\'s\\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\\n\\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\\nhad Cooper discussed last August\\'s events, Cooper responded, \"If\\nyou\\'re implying that we got our story together, you\\'re wrong,\\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense\\'s version of\\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\\nkilling the Weaver\\'s dog.  Cooper disagreed.\\n\\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence\\'s\\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \\nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\\ndefense\\'s version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I\\'m not going to play games with either\\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\\nacting like professionals.\"\\n\\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we\\'ll see\\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \\nSpence continued, \"We\\'re going to find...that there is a very unlikely\\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\\n\\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen\\'s repeated\\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can\\'t have a fair trial if the\\njury believes I\\'m some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I\\'m\\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I\\'m\\nviolating court orders.\"\\n\\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen\\'s\\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\\nhis comments when objecting.\\n\\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\\nRampton.  The prosecution\\'s purpose was simply to introduce five\\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\\non the opportunity to further address Cooper\\'s credibility.\\n\\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris\\' other attorney) questioned\\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\\nplans to kill the Weaver\\'s dog without being detected.  Matthews then\\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"\\n\\nMonday, April 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.  Scheduled\\nis the continued cross-examination of FBI agent Greg Rampton.\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the\\ncrowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real-\\nistically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they\\nstill go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the\\ngame by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the\\nNBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is \\nbringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are\\ntrying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect \\nexamples of players that real fans know aren\\'t worth a damn and yet, being\\nbenificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals\\nthat would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to\\nattract, that these players are indeed superstars.\\n\\n>>They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is \\n>>true.

Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\\n>amazing, I\\'ll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we\\'ve got a *kick*\\n>*ass* guy on *our* side, I\\'ll go watch him play\".  I think it was the latter.\\n\\nIt ain\\'t nearly so simple as this.  The casual fan doesn\\'t think about much \\nat all.

He was hyped, initially, as a superstar, but outside of\\none Grey Cup game he has done very little to maintain/enhance that assess-\\nment of his talents.  Most Argo fans probably feel the team would be better\\noff without him. \\n\\ncordially, as always,\\n\\nrm\\n\\n-- \\nRoger Maynard \\nmaynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca \\n'},\n",

Does it already exist?\\n\\nWhile I don\\'t know the full scope of the activities of the EFF, \\nfrom what little I\\'ve seen I think it would be better to lobby for \\nstrong cryptography through a distinct organization.\\n\\nThe EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex\\nand pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the\\ncontents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged\\nmodels) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin\\nalready raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one\\nstep removed from the old \"crypto-wielding child molester\" argument.  An\\nEFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the\\nconnection to child pornography and the like.\\n\\nSimilarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In\\nlight of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate it\\nstands to be labelled as \"communist\", \"anarchist hackers\", radical, etc.  \\n\\nI don\\'t know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social\\nResponsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical\\nantinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political\\nbaggage.\\n\\nPerhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography\\nwould best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing\\ngroup, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to\\nadvocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein\\'s\\nquestion: does any suitable organization exist?  If not, what are you going\\nto do about it?\\n\\nHaving mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations,\\nI would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction:\\ngathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the\\nissue as well as the First-Amendment side.\\n\\n\\n\\nTal  kubo@math.harvard.edu\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started \\nwith a solid single to right, moved to second on \"Bob\" Kelly\\'s infield sneaker\\ndown the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson\\'s well-placed bunt--a \\nrare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.\\n\\nCincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only \\ngiven up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double\\nby Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after\\nJoe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who \\nargued plate umpire Kellogg\\'s inside strike by \"drawing the line\" (really, he\\nshould know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting\\ntossed.\\n\\nThe Mets\\' fifth started with a Howard Johnson\\'s first-pitch homer.  Pugh must \\nhave been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent\\'s\\nsingle, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell\\nand turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley\\'s grounder to the drawn-in Branson\\nfailed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:\\n\\nSaberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield\\nto discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:\\nThompson was hung out to dry after Pugh\\'s first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.\\n(Isn\\'t the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)\\n\\nThe Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin\\'s\\nground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back\\nsingles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long\\nfly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but\\nthird base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was\\nhung out to dry killing the Reds rally.\\n\\nRob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner\\non second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game\\nin late August last year when Bonilla\\'s three-run dinger slapped a loss on\\nDibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci\\'s season.  Bonilla ended\\nup walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a \\nweek, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went\\nto Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings\\nwork, striking out three.

A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks\\n  (similar to today\\'s checking system except entirely digital) may\\n  be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and\\n  anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an\\n  economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum\\n  (~Dec.1992).\\n\\n  An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus\\n  <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the\\n  cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to\\n  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:\\n\\n    ::\\n    command: help\\n    \\n    user@host\\n\\n  where `user@host\\' is your email address.\\n \\n  \\n_____\\n<5.2> What is a ``hacker\\'\\' or ``cracker\\'\\'?\\n\\n  These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,\\n  especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past\\n  a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as\\n  breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most\\n  internet users prefer the term ``cracker\\'\\' for this.  Instead, a\\n  ``hacker\\'\\' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,\\n  curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a\\n  system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and\\n  patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also\\n  the ``Hacker\\'s Dictionary\\'\\' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq\\'.\\n \\n \\n_____\\n<5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk\\'\\'?\\n\\n  From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:\\n\\n  > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were\\n  > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy\\n  > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,\\n  > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant\\n  > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people\\n  > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,\\n  > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek\\n  > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or\\n  > their opinions.\\n\\n  See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.\\n\\n  See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary\\n  in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.\\n\\n_____\\n<5.4> What is `steganography\\' and anonymous pools?\\n\\n  Closely associated with encryption is `steganography\\' or the\\n  techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication\\n  but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself. \\n  Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the\\n  proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible\\n  to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,\\n  typically the most \\'noisy\\'. In addition, when such an item is\\n  posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually\\n  untraceable  communication can take place between sender and\\n  receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic\\n  realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where\\n  individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual\\n  users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An\\n  anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman\\n  (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to\\n  <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following\\n  commands in the subject line:\\n\\n    subscribe\\n    unsubscribe\\n    help\\n\\n_____\\n<5.5> What is `security through obscurity\\'?\\n\\n  `Security through obscurity\\' refers to the attempt to gain\\n  protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information\\n  or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make\\n  public information on its software\\'s encryption techniques to evade\\n  `attacks\\' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be\\n  concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in\\n  operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that\\n  some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious\\n  because they are ``not widely known\\'\\' or ``not widely used.\\'\\' This\\n  argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet\\n  posting `forgery\\'. `Security through obscurity\\' is regarded as a\\n  very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at\\n  worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach\\'\\'). See the FAQ\\n  for alt.security.  \\n  \\n  Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic\\n  Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First\\n  International Symposium on National Security & National\\n  Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:\\n\\n  > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep\\n  > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It\\'s\\n  > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If\\n  > something hits the Net and it\\'s something which people on there\\n  > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.

And there will be very little\\n  > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,\\n  > but you may differ...\\n\\n_____\\n<5.6> What are `identity daemons\\'?\\n  \\n  RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to\\n  query a remote user\\'s login name after connection to a local\\n  communication socket (a connection of this type is established\\n  during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not\\n  widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement\\n  it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to\\n  anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system\\n  adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a\\n  trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.\\n\\n_____\\n<5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?\\n\\n\\n  Remailing/Posting\\n  -----------------\\n  \\n  - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,\\n    publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.\\n  - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET\\n    postings.\\n  - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information\\n    obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,\\n    encrypted addresses, etc.)\\n  - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and\\n    remailer site chaining.\\n  \\n  General\\n  -------\\n  \\n  - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy\\n    shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the\\n    general public and their governments.\\n  - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies \\n    by systems designers into\\n    hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,\\'\\n    `seamlessly,\\' and `transparently\\'.\\n  - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than\\n    wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement\\n    agencies.\\n  - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government\\n    agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to\\n    strengthening and protecting it.\\n\\n\\nISSUES\\n======\\n\\n_____\\n<6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?\\n\\n  From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:\\n\\n  > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic\\n  > media which connect us.

It is involved in  litigation\\n  against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other\\n  U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation\\n  on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,\\n  NSA\\'s interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in\\n  Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on\\n  Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to\\n  testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and\\n  caller identification.\\n\\n  CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available\\n  via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising\\n  the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For\\n  more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.\\n\\n\\n  (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions\\n  here.)\\n\\n_____\\n<6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil\\' and the Steve Jackson Game case?\\n\\n  In the early 1990\\'s a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies\\n  on the illicit activities of `hackers\\' and `phreakers\\' involved in\\n  such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.\\n  \\n  (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):\\n\\n  > `Operation Sundevil,\\' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May\\n  > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card\\n  > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success. \\n  > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying\\n  > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of\\n  > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some\\n  > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department\\n  > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide\\n  > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of\\n  > jurisdictions.\\n\\n  Massive `show-trials\\' never materialized, although isolated\\n  instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a\\n  crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal\\n  search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of\\n  Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS\\' LABOUR LOST\\n  by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science\\n  Fiction Magazine:\\n\\n  > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional\\n  > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the\\n  > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared\\n  > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,\\n  > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin\\n  > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only\\n  > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place. \\n  > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that\\n  > somewhere in Jackson\\'s office there `might be\\' a document\\n  > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.\\n\\n  FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed\\n  on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier\\n  Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe\\n  Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:\\n  \\n  > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret\\n  > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal\\n  > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a\\n  > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,\\n  > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment. \\n  > \\n  > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in\\n  > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,\\n  > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark\\'s rebuke\\n  > over the Service\\'s poor investigation and abusive computer\\n  > seizure policies.  While the Service has seized dozens of\\n  > computers since the crackdown began in 1990, this is the first\\n  > case to challenge the practice. \\n  > \\n  > Sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the Austin\\n  > science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never\\n  > suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal\\n  > research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and\\n  > the suspected illegal activities of an employee, or to determine\\n  > that the company was a publisher. Indeed, agents testified that\\n  > they were not even trained in the Privacy Protection Act at the\\n  > special Secret Service school on computer crime. \\n  > \\n  > \"How long would it have taken you, Mr. Foley, to find out what\\n  > Steve Jackson Games did, what it was?\" asked Sparks. \"An hour? \\n  > \\n  > \"Was there any reason why, on March 2, you could not return to\\n  > Steve Jackson Games a copy, in floppy disk form, of everything\\n  > taken? \\n  > \\n  > \"Did you read the article in Business Week magazine where it had\\n  > a picture of Steve Jackson -- a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen\\n  > -- saying he was a computer crime suspect? \\n  > \\n  > \"Did it ever occur to you, Mr. Foley, that seizing this material\\n  > could harm Steve Jackson economically?\" \\n  > \\n  > Foley replied, \"No, sir,\" but the judge offered his own answer. \\n  > \\n  > \"You actually did, you just had no idea anybody would actually go\\n  > out and hire a lawyer and sue you.\" \\n  > \\n  > More than $200,000 has been spent by the Electronic Frontier \\n  > Foundation in bringing the case to trial.

Most if not all Arabs are sympathetic to the Palestinian war \\nagainst Israel.  That is why the ADL monitors Arab organizations.  That is\\nthe same reason the US monitored communist organizations and Soviet nationals\\nonly a few years ago.  \\n\\n>Perhaps Yigal is a Greenpeace member? Or the NAACP?

The ADL is simply monitoring them so that if\\nanything comes up, they won\\'t be caught by surprise.\\n\\n>>2. Why does the ADL have an interest in that person ?\\n\\n>Paranoia?\\n\\nNo, that is why World Trade Center bombings don\\'t happen in Israel (aside from\\nthe fact that there is no world trade center) and why people like Zein Isa (\\nPalestinian whose American group planned to bow up the Israeli Embassy and \\n\"kill many Jews.\") are caught.

The tool survived\\n the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot\\n altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.\\n\\n    NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,\\n\\n    \"It\\'s been a long time since something like this happened.  We\\'ve\\n lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this.\"\\n\\n    The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a\\n Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on\\n April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker\\'s supervisor did not act on the\\n report and Discovery was launched with its \"extra payload\".  NASA\\n officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th\\n launch date.\\n\\n    The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB\\n technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,\\n its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a\\n part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.\\n|(Ron\\'s ed. note:  naaahhh,  just too easy)\\n\\n    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that\\n the Shuttle processor will take \"appropriate action\".

All advice was taken to heart, if not directly used.  My friend\\nfound out about the matter quite accidently.  After reading some of my\\nmail, I quit from the mail reader & went about my business.  I must have\\ntrashed my mail improperly, because he got on the same terminal the next\\nday & saw my old messages.  He thought they were responses to a post he\\nplaced in alt.atheism earlier that week, so he read some of them before\\nrealizing that they were for me.  I got a message from him the next day; he\\napologized for reading my mail & said that he did not want to appear to be\\na snoop.  He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views &\\ndidn\\'t mind doing so, especially with a friend.  So we did.  I neither\\nchanged his mind nor did he change mine, as that was not the point.  Now he\\nknows where I\\'m coming from & now I know where he\\'s coming from.  And all\\nthat I can do is pray for him, as I\\'ve always done.\\n\\nI believe the reason that he & I \"click\" instead of \"bash\" heads is because\\nI see Christianity as a tool for revolution, & not a tool for maintaining\\nthe status quo.  To be quite blunt, I have more of a reason to reject God\\nthan he does just by the fact that I am an African-American female. \\nChristianity & religion have been used as tools to separate my people from\\nthe true knowledge of our history & the wealth of our contributions to the\\nworld society.  The \"kitchen of heaven\" was all we had to look forward to\\nduring the slave days, & this mentality & second-class status still exists\\ntoday.  I, too, have rejected\\nan aspect of Christianity----that of the estabished church.  Too much\\nhypocricy exists behind the walls of \"God\\'s house\" beginning with the\\nimages of a white Jesus to that of the members:  praise God on Sunday &\\nraise hell beginning Monday.  God-willing, I will find a church home where\\nI can feel comfortable & at-home, but I don\\'t see it happening anytime\\nsoon.\\n\\nSherlette \\n'},\n",

The tendonitis is\\nquite painful yet my friend's doctor has not recommended any form of treatment\\nto relieve it.\\n\\nThe latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti-inflammatories and is\\nnow recommending Prednisone.

Second, the historical\\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \\nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius\\'s\\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\\na la Chalcedon.\\n\\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\\nthat Jesus\\'s human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\\nprevailed.\\n\\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\\n\\nJason Albert\\n\\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn\\'t see how we could call\\nJesus fully human, because he didn\\'t sin.  I completely agree that\\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\\n\\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there\\'s reason to think\\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\\ngot the better of them.\\n\\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\\nmust be understood that there\\'s a certain indirectness in the Logos\\'\\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don\\'t have an\\nincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white\\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\\narea.\\n\\nYou say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus\\'s\\nhuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don\\'t think that\\'s required by\\northodox doctrine.  It\\'s the divine Logos that is eternal.\\n\\n--clh]\\n'},\n",

Your mention of \"[esteeming] \\nall days alike\" IMO has to do with the fast days observed by the Jews.  But \\nno matter how you interpret that passage, I do accept your worship on Sunday \\nas being done in honor of the Lord, in contrast with what many of my fellow \\nSDA believers may believe.  To me, though, the bible overwhelmingly points \\nto Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of God\\'s \\ndeliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.  To those who would \\nattempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic, \\nthis is simply not the case.  Rather, keeping Saturday allows me a full day \\nto rest and contemplate God\\'s goodness and grace.\\n\\n>\\n>However I\\'d like to be clear that I do not think there\\'s unambiguous\\n>proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\\n>indicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\\n\\n>Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\\n>that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul\\'s\\n>collection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\\n>to do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can\\'t disprove it,\\n>but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\\n>when they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\\n>it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\\n\\nThe idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted the \\nCorinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the \\nweek was because that was when they received their weekly wages.  Paul \\nwanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority, before \\nspending their money on other things.  I do not have any proof in front of \\nme for this though, although it would explain why they would lay aside money \\nin their homes instead of a meeting.  \\n\\n>So I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day\\n>of every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \\n>\\n>I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\\n>is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\\n>worship was.\\n\\nIt would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the NT regularly \\nworshipped on the first day.  I assume that the christians in the NT \\nregularly worshipped on the seventh day.  But I agree with you that we only \\nhave implications because the authors did assume the reader knew when worhip \\nwas.\\n\\n--Mark\\n'},\n",

There are 8 multiplexed\\ninputs sharing the single A/D, so that all inputs are not samples at the\\nsame time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate\\nmust be used. Thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits\\nat 50 kHz per channel. This is poorer quality than the national\\nInstruments, at the same sample rate.\\n\\nD/A: 16 bit converter.

Moreover the Buddha says that we are \\n> intrinsically good (as against Christ\\'s \"we are all sinners\").\\n\\nI never thought of these two ideas being \"against\" each other.\\nPeople might quibble about what \"intrinsically\" means but the\\nreason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we\\nare. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good,\\nbut great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a \\ndifferent technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do\\nnot realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking \\non water until a little doubt crept in.\\n\\nDoesn\\'t David ask in the 8th Psalm \"what is man that you [God] \\nshould care for him, but you have made him just a little lower \\nthan the angels\"?\\n\\nI probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David\\nwas, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath\\nwas, but David\\'s power easily defeated Goliath\\'s.\\n\\nRemember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what\\nhe can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments.\\nI always picture the smug look on his face as he says he\\'s done that\\nhis whole life, probably anticipating an \"attaboy\" from the \\nMessiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything\\nand follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say\\nhow can anyone do this if it\\'s so hard even for rich people.\\nJesus says anyone can do it, with God\\'s help.\\n\\nJesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid\\ngetting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing\\nadultery, we can control our own desires. \\n\\nI realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other\\npeople see this. \\n\\n> ...\\n> \\tParting Question:\\n> \\t\\tWould you have become a Christian if you had not\\n> been indoctrinated by your parents? You probably never learned about\\n> any other religion to make a comparative study. And therefore I claim\\n> you are brain washed.\\n\\n(Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)\\n\\nYour point about how \"hard\" other religions are is a good one, just \\nas your \"Parting Question\" is a tough question. I think that Muslims\\nworship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name \"submission\".\\nHindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that \"God\" is impersonal. \\nIs God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little\\nmore my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater \\nto be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but\\nyou\\'re right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more\\nI must admit that God\\'s personal nature is as far beyond my\\nconception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu\\'s\\nconception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology\\nthen maybe I wouldn\\'t have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.\\n\\nAre there any former (or present) \"Eastern Religion\" members here \\nwho could comment?\\n\\nChris Mussack\\n'},\n",

Verbitsky) writes:\\n\\n>\\tActually, Jarmo is a permanent resident of my killfile\\n\\nAnyone care to speculate on this? I\\'ll let the rest of the net judge\\nthis on its own merits. Between 1914 and 1920, 2.5 million Turks perished \\nof butchery at the hands of Armenians. The genocide involved not only \\nthe killing of innocents but their forcible deportation from the Russian \\nArmenia. They were persecuted, banished, and slaughtered while much of \\nOttoman Army was engaged in World War I. The Genocide Treaty defines \\ngenocide as acting with a \\n\\n  \\'specific intent to destroy, in whole or in substantial part, a \\n   national, ethnic, racial or religious group.\\' \\n\\nHistory shows that the x-Soviet Armenian Government intended to eradicate \\nthe Muslim population. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were exterminated by the \\nArmenians. International diplomats in Ottoman Empire at the time - including \\nU.S. Ambassador Bristol - denounced the x-Soviet Armenian Government\\'s policy \\nas a massacre of the Kurds, Turks, and Tartars. The blood-thirsty leaders of \\nthe x-Soviet Armenian Government at the time personally involved in the \\nextermination of the Muslims. The Turkish genocide museums in Turkiye honor \\nthose who died during the Turkish massacres perpetrated by the Armenians. \\n\\nThe eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established,\\nbeyond any doubt, that the massacres against the Muslim people\\nduring the war were planned and premeditated. The aim of the policy\\nwas clearly the extermination of all Turks in x-Soviet Armenian \\nterritories.\\n\\nThe Muslims of Van, Bitlis, Mus, Erzurum and Erzincan districts and\\ntheir wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.\\nThe massacres in Trabzon, Tercan, Yozgat and Adana were organized and\\nperpetrated by the blood-thirsty leaders of the x-Soviet Armenian \\nGovernment.\\n\\nThe principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent Muslims were\\nDro, Antranik, Armen Garo, Hamarosp, Daro Pastirmadjian, Keri,\\nKarakin, Haig Pajise-liantz and Silikian.\\n\\nSource: \"Bristol Papers\", General Correspondence: Container #32 - Bristol\\n         to Bradley Letter of September 14, 1920.\\n\\n\"I have it from absolute first-hand information that the Armenians in \\n the Caucasus attacked Tartar (Turkish) villages that are utterly \\n defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder\\n the inhabitants, pillage the village and often burn the village.\"\\n\\n\\nSources: (The Ottoman State, the Ministry of War), \"Islam Ahalinin \\nDucar Olduklari Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat,\" (Istanbul, 1918). \\nThe French version: \"Documents Relatifs aux Atrocites Commises par les Armeniens\\nsur la Population Musulmane,\" (Istanbul, 1919). In the Latin script: H. K.\\nTurkozu, ed., \"Osmanli ve Sovyet Belgeleriyle Ermeni Mezalimi,\" (Ankara,\\n1982). In addition: Z. Basar, ed., \"Ermenilerden Gorduklerimiz,\" (Ankara,\\n1974) and, edited by the same author, \"Ermeniler Hakkinda Makaleler -\\nDerlemeler,\" (Ankara, 1978). \"Askeri Tarih Belgeleri ...,\" Vol. 32, 83\\n(December 1983), document numbered 1881.\\n\"Askeri Tarih Belgeleri ....,\" Vol. 31, 81 (December 1982), document\\n numbered 1869.\\n\\n\"Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning\\n with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken\\n in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army\\n withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian\\n massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked\\n in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places\\n selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs\\n were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after\\n being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part \\n of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the\\n cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering\\n from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived\\n in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.\\n Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not\\n exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in\\n Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything\\n that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them\\n in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting\\n on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages\\n left behind after their occupation of this area.\"\\n \\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

A button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item\\nto be drawn in the Window.  This action clearly should not call XCopyArea() \\n(or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new\\nitem in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles\\n\"regular\" expose events (e.g. window manager-driven exposures) take care\\nof rendering the new image.  Using an expose event handler is a \"proper\" way\\nto do this because at the time the handler is called, the Xlib Window is\\nguaranteed to be mapped.\\n\\nThe problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window\\nis already visible and mapped.  What we need to do is somehow \"tickle\" the\\nWindow so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable\\nit to render *just* the part of the window that contains the new item.\\n\\nWhat is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior?\\n'},\n",

It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get\\n   a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I\\n   was told by a police officer.\\n2.

Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will\\n   be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.\\n   The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form\\n   authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.  \\n   Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these\\n   'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will\\n   be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess\\n   them, but will not be allowed to stock them.\\n4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will\\n   not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations\\n   specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some \\n   manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.\\n   (God knows how much they'll charge for these)\\n\\nThis covers most of what we discussed.

I\\'m very busy and don\\'t have time to chit-\\nchat with you!\"  I told him I was simply following his instructions to\\ncall on the 7th day to status him, and that I was feeling worse.  I \\nthen asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he\\nhad more time.  He responded, \"Just spit it out now because no time is\\na good time.\"  (Said in a raised voice.)  I started to feel upset and\\ntried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my\\nnervousness interfered with my choice of words and I kind of stuttered\\nand then said \"well, never mind\" and he said he\\'ll talk to various\\ncolleagues about other medications and he\\'ll call me some other time.\\n\\nThis doctor called me that evening and said because I didn\\'t express\\nmyself well, he was confused about what I wanted.  At this point I\\nwas pretty upset and I told him (in an amazingly polite voice considering\\nhow angry I felt) that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings.  He told\\nme that he just doesn\\'t have time to \"rap with patients\" and thought\\nthat was what I wanted.  I told him that to assume I was calling to\\n\"rap\" was insulting, and said again that I was just following through\\non his orders.  He responded that he resented the implication that he \\nfelt I was making that he was not interested in learning about what his\\npatients have to say about their condition status.  He then gave me\\nthis apology: \"I am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you\\nmistakenly thought I was insulting.  I am not trying to insult you\\nbut I am not that knowledgeable about pain, and I don\\'t have a lot of\\ntime to deal with that.\"  He then told me to call him the next day\\nfor further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication.\\n\\nI am still upset and have not yet called.\\n\\nMy questions: (1) Should I continue to have this doctor manage my care?\\n(2) Since I am in pain off and on, I realize that this may cause me to\\nbe more anxietous so am I perhaps over-reacting or overly sensitive?\\nIf this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type\\nof pain I have, he still wants me to status him on my condition but\\nnow I am afraid to call him.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t--Marlena\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING.  You have\\nlife forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal\\ntorment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to \\nlive it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And that\\nwas the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It\\'s\\nwishful thinking.\\n \\n>Nope -- most people are Christian.

You enjoy darkness, and you\\'re proud of it.\\n\\nIs this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Most\\npeople, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that they\\nare imperfect.  Is \"the world an undesireable place\" a doctrine\\nof Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  Does\\nKendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship?\\nMine doesn\\'t.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?  \\nMine doesn\\'t.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the\\npriest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn\\'t.  Is this\\na bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being \\nignorant of the Bible?\\n\\nBrian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism.\\nYou would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don\\'t follow Kendigianism.\\nI follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignorance\\nof Christ and the Bible in regards to \"priests\",  have you not read about\\nthe sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what the\\npurpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should\\nNOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I do\\nnot follow Catholicism or any \"ism.\"  I follow Christ.\\n\\n>Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your\\n>failures; then you die.

Don\\'t contradict yourself.  You have\\nno reason to live a good life.  It doesn\\'t do you any good in the\\nend.  Your life doesn\\'t do anybody else any good  either because\\neveryone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading\\na good life is meaningless.

Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the\\ninput of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both\\nchips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.  \\n\\nIf you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an\\noutboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good\\nenough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and\\nbalance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs of\\nthe volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably \\nbefore the other controls).  \\n\\nIf the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should\\nprobably forget the whole thing. \\n\\n\\t--- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CA\\nInternet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055\\n'},\n",

In fact,\\n>it doesn\\'t mean *anything*, because the units are screwy.\\n\\nI agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result\\nin 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%\\ndoes not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would\\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\\npositive association between John\\'s statistic and winning games.  Thus,\\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\\n\\n>Consider an example:  Bob hits a 2-out solo HR in the bottom of the first;\\n>about .12 on your scale.  He does the same thing again in the fourth, with\\n>the score tied, for another .14.  And again, in the seventh, with the score\\n>tied, for another .22.  And, finally, in the ninth to win the game by a score\\n>of 7-6, for a value of 0.5.  Bob hit 4 solo HR in 4 plate appearances, and\\n>was credited by your method with .12 + .14 + .22 + .5 = .98.  But what does\\n>that mean?  Was Bob 98% responsible for the win?  Certainly not; the defense\\n>is *always* 50% responsible (if you include pitching in that), and Bob wasn\\'t\\n>pitching.  In fact, Bob was only 4/7 of the offense (which is a lot, but not\\n>even close to 100%).  Furthermore, what about the other 3 team runs?  Say\\n>they all came on solo HR by Fred; then Fred was hitting HR to tie up the game,\\n>which are just as valuable as HR to take the lead (see Lindsey), and Fred will\\n>himself have accrued a good .4 rating or so.  So Fred and Bob combined have\\n>amassed 138% of a win IN ONE GAME.  There\\'s clearly a problem here.\\n\\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\\nThus, I\\'m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\\nthe pitchers\\' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \\n\\n\\n\\n>>Greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the\\n>>mark.  Closers are enormously important.  The total number of runs\\n>>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming.\\n>>The doubling which Greg allows is not enough.\\n>\\n>In another article, I proposed a test of this.  We can predict a team\\'s \\n>won/lost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs *total* they\\n>score and allow, without regard to when those runs score in the game.  If\\n>late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at\\n>late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right?\\n\\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \\nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \\n\\n>Here\\'s another thought experiment: apply this method to basketball.  What\\n>you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost\\n>exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play.\\n>Furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with\\n>no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who \\n>scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero.\\n>\\n>Does this make sense?\\n\\n\\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\\nwould win.\\n \\nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\\ngoes down.  I\\'ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\\n\\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K\\'s, BB\\'s,\\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \\npitcher?  They were probably about the same.\\n\\n                                                        Brian Smith\\n'},\n",

When I\\noriginally purchased it, I experienced the failure to boot problem.  This\\nwas fixed soon after by a ROM upgrade on the hard drive.\\n\\nLately a similar problem has been occuring.  When the computer is\\npowered on the HD light flashes a few times and then I am given\\nthe \"no disk to boot from\" icon.  However, upon turing the\\ncomputer off and on again the drive ALWAYS boots up just fine.  \\nFurthermore, if instead of turning the power on and off I press the reboot \\nbutton the same problem occurs.  But, as I said, turning the power\\noff and on always works.\\n\\nThis problem is different from the 1989 boot problem in that before\\nit often required several power off and ons to get it to boot.\\n\\nDoes anybody have any suggestions as to what the problem is or how\\nit can be fixed?\\n\\nI\\'m wondering if it\\'s getting old and requires more time to \\n\"come up to speed\" now.  Is there a PRAM or SCSI setting that\\nallows me to tell the computer to wait a little longer before \\ntrying to access the HD?\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\n\\nAltan J.

Of cause, the R4-version\\n\\tdid not know about the xpTableWidgetClass (we used tableWidgetClass \\t\\t\\tinstead - caught from the net in times of R3) and XpTableChildPosition \\t\\t\\t(formerly XtTblPosition).\\n\\tSince compiling with R5, the program causes a zero width or height error\\n\\t(on sparc-stations). The trouble-shooter is the (re)computation of the\\n\\tmodel_init_table - table widget: though its childs (label and asciiText \\n\\twidgets) exist, XtQueryGeometry returns a prefered width and height of \\t\\t\\tzero. \\n\\tThus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the \\t\\t\\twidth and height of the newly created widget to zero. No wonder XtPopup \\t\\tor XtManage- Child create zero width or height errors (dependent on \\t\\t\\twhether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource \\t\\t\\tfile or not).\\n\\t\\n\\tQuestion: Does anyone know, why XtQueryGeometry returns so low prefered\\n\\t\\t\\tvalues when working on table widgets or perhaps what\\n\\t\\t\\tto do about?\\n\\n\\tI\\'ll be happy, if someone is able to help me. \\n\\tGermans are requested to answer in german.\\n\\t\\n\\tSiegfried Kaiser\\n\\temail: kaiser@uniko.uni-koblenz.de\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tThe part of interest:\\n\\n\\n\\t/* Graphischer Neuaufbau des Model-Init-Formulars */\\n\\t\\t/* Storing the old width and height of the viewport-\\t*/\\n\\t\\t/* widget, which is the parent of the troubling table\\t*/\\n\\t\\t/* widget, before the viewport widget is destroyed\\t*/\\n\\t\\t/* The destroying of widgets before resizing them is a\\t*/\\n\\t\\t/* relict from R3-age\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t*/\\n\\t\\n\\tif (model_init_popped_up) \\n\\t\\tXtUnmapWidget(model_init_form_view);\\n\\tXtDestroyWidget(model_init_form_view);\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t/* Creating the subtree within the shell, of which the\\t*/\\n\\t\\t/* root is the viewport widget\\t\\t\\t\\t*/\\n\\t\\n\\tn = 0;\\n\\tXtSetArg(args[n],XtNfromVert,model_init_title); n++;\\n\\tXtSetArg(args[n],XtNfromHoriz,model_init_button_view); n++;\\n\\tXtSetArg(args[n],XtNallowVert,True); n++;\\n\\tXtSetArg(args[n],XtNforceBars,True); n++;\\n\\tmodel_init_form_view = XtCreateWidget(\"form_view\",viewportWidgetClass,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      model_init_form,args,n);\\n\\n\\tn = 0;\\n\\tmodel_init_table = XtCreateWidget(\"table\",xpTableWidgetClass,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  model_init_form_view,args,n);\\n\\n\\t\\t/* create_form_widget does create and position table\\t*/\\n\\t\\t/* widget\\'s childs.

Security Council Resolution 713 of \\n  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively \\n  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security \\n  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all \\n  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There \\n  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages \\n  in Bosnia have been bombed.\\n  \\n  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, \\n  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all \\n  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize \\n  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-\\n  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  \\n  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air \\n  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General \\n  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY \\n  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating \\n  allies.\\n  \\n  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my \\n  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to \\n  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct \\n  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by \\n  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces \\n  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and \\n  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  \\n  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. \\n  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for \\n  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.\\n  \\n  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air \\n  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early \\n  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally \\n  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the \\n  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching \\n  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, \\n  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these \\n  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such \\n  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by \\n  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved \\n  \\n                                more\\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\t     \\t       \\t    (OVER)\\n\\x0c\\n                                  2\\n  \\n  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will \\n  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations \\n  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was \\n  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully \\n  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.\\n  \\n  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such \\n  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces \\n  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional \\n  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-\\n  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and \\n  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward \\n  toward attainment of our goals in this region.\\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\tSincerely,\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\tWILLIAM J.

The opinions expressed are those\\n              of the user and not necessarily those of Oracle.\\nLines: 41\\n\\n\\nAs the subjects says, Windows 3.1 keeps crashing (givinh me GPF) on me of  \\nlate.  It was never a very stable package, but now it seems to crash every  \\nday.  The worst part about it is that it does not crash consistently: ie I  \\ncan't reproduce crashes, and they are not always GPF's in the same  \\napplication. Sometimes I can recover by simply closing the application  \\nthat caused an error, but other times, windows acts very strange, and I  \\nneed to re-boot.\\n\\nSome background:  I have a Leading Edge 486sx25 with Phoenix BIOS.  When I  \\nfirst got it it had 4Mg of memory.  It ran windows fine (not too many  \\nGPF's).  Then, a couple of weekends ago, I installed Lotus 123 for windows  \\n(with ATM), a game card and an additional 4  1Mg SIMMS.  The Leading edge  \\nmachine is kind of strange, in that it has the IDE controler built into  \\nthe motherboard, the CPU is actually on a sparate board that plugs into  \\nthe motherboard and the SIMMS it uses are Macintosh SIMMS! Apparently I  \\nwas told that the Leading Edge had the parity bit built into the mother  \\nboard.  The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS where of the 2 chip variety from  \\nSAMSUNG, and the ones I installed are 8 chip SIMMS. They are recognized  \\nfine by the BIOS RAM check. The game card is a generic $20 gamecard.\\n\\nThe reason why I mention the hardware like this is that sometimes  \\nrebooting the machine using the reset button or ctl-alt-del still leaves  \\nthe machine kind of flaky, but turning it on and off doesn't. \\n\\nI haven't tried taking out the RAM or the game card, because as I said  \\nthese GPF are not reproducible at will.  I have gone through and entire  \\nday using the computer with no problems and then I might get 5 or so GPF's  \\nin the sppace of 20 minutes?\\n\\nWhat can I do.  This situation is most annoying... Are there any good  \\ndiagnostic tools for hardware? Do you think that this might be a software  \\nproblem (ie EMM386 etc.)? If it helps, i have manage to get GPF's on After  \\nDark, quicken, Paint shop pro. A lot of them have been in user.exe or  \\ngdi.exe.\\n\\nAny help is truly appreciated.....\\n\\n-Eric\\n\\nebosco@us.oracle.com\\n\"},\n",

The government provides free health care to all U.S. \\n>residents. And there are no out-of-pocket costs. \\n\\nWrong.  In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health\\ninsurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like\\nsocialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary\\ninsurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine\\'s Summer 1992 edition\\nhas a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,\\nincluding a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,\\nyou\\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.\\nWith extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and\\nbe covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The\\npublic insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount\\nfor a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or\\naccording to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of\\nFrench have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health\\ncosts in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other\\ntaxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures\\nfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure\\nfor the U.S.\\n\\nThat the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund\\nis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back\\nin Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health\\ninsurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff\\nof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \"libertarian\"\\nfaction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that\\njust a few people have to be reminded that it\\'s not free (the average\\nCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American\\ncounterparts on issues like these).\\n\\nI\\'m one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about\\nleftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian\\nnewsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, \\'cos the 100%\\ninsurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn\\'t know\\nit, you\\'d believe it actually is socialized medicine (American\\nconservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who\\nseriously call it that).  Canadians aren\\'t worried about the\\nAmericans, who spend 14%; we\\'re worried about the French and Germans\\nwho spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that\\nshouldn\\'t be paid for out of general funds like physicals for\\ninsurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that\\nthe Canadian health insurance hasn\\'t spiralled out of control despite\\nbeing open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to\\nspend all of your benefits\\' worth, and more if you can ... we\\'re a\\ndifferent culture.\\n\\n>Like the play or pay model, managed competition leaves in place two \\n>elements of the current health care system that reformers most often \\n>criticize: the private, for-profit insurance industry; and the \\n>employer-based system of coverage. Managed competition compels \\n>employers to enroll their workers in large pools of health insurance \\n>customers. Entire industries may, for example, sponsor a pool or \\n>network. Insurance companies, doctors, hospitals and other health \\n>care providers then bid for the pool\\'s business, competing- in \\n>theory- on the basis of price and quality. \\n\\n\"Managed Care\" relies on HMO\\'s, which are unknown in most western\\nnations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France\\nand Germany (I\\'m Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says\\nof HMO/NHS approaches, \"We left that behind with East Germany!\").\\nSure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling\\ndoctors with budget strings.\\n\\nIn Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France\\nand Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public\\nhospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO\\'s.  The divisions\\nare different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked\\n\"sickness funds\" over a century old while Canada divides by their\\nprovinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the\\ndoctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)\\n\\nWith such an open-ended system, it\\'s no surprise that Canada is #2 to\\nthe U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The\\nFrench and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations\\nin more compact geography to improve scales of economy.\\n\\ngld\\n--\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\nGary L.

Not surprisingly, literature promoting cognitive\\ntherapy also claims to be superior.\\n\\nWhat are the facts?  Early in my research I didn\\'t have a\\nbias towards either medication or cognitive therapy.  I\\nwas interested in a treatment that worked.  After reading\\njournals published after 1986, the cognitive therapy camp\\nclaims a higher success rate (approx 80%), a lower drop-out\\nrate, and no side effects associated with medication.\\n\\nLars-Goran Ost published an excellent article titled\\n\"Applied Relaxation: Description of a coping technique and\\na review of controlled studies.\"  This is from Behav.

Before\\nyou can buy a handgun, you have to be an active member of a gun club.\\nWell, how active can you be without a gun, chief?\\n\\nMost gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental\\ndisorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn\\'t be abused by the\\ngovernment.  But every time this is proposed, there is always some\\ntrapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you\\nare perfectly qualified to own a gun.  And we oppose this.\\n\\n> It\\'s a little like getting a drivers licence isn\\'t it ???\\n> You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...\\n\\nSince the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US \\nis around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun\\nowners, I\\'d think twice before using this analogy.\\n\\nBesides, the problem is criminal use of guns, not accidents.  (There\\nare about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but\\nonly 1,400 accidents.)  I don\\'t think it\\'s necessary to spend a lot\\nof energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one.\\n\\nJust like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiring\\nsafety courses -- IF they couldn\\'t be abused by the government.  But \\nthey already have!  One state doesn\\'t hold the courses, another doesn\\'t \\nfund them, a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence \\nto those with political connections.  Is this fair?\\n\\n> Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short \\n> time befor the crime.\\n\\nAnd how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets?\\nHow many are borrowed, stolen, smuggled, bought on the black market?\\n\\n> Use of knives:\\n> It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or \\'open\\'.\\n> You (Americans) think it\\'s ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open\\n> in public -rigth ??\\n\\nSome states allow ONLY open carry.  Some allow ONLY concealed carry.\\nSome allow both.  Some allow both, but require licenses for concealed \\ncarry.  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage\\nover another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good,\\nthen state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing.\\nWhich means that they really don\\'t have any objective reasons for \\nthese laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern.\\n\\n> Scandinavians ARE \\'aggressive\\':\\n> We northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners, but when we decide\\n> to take action we DO.\\n\\n(\"Hot-livered.\"  I LOVE that expression.

The rest of our criminals\\naffect the rights of only one or a few people at a time, and they do this\\nduring the commission of a crime.  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts\\nNO ONE else.  It is when they do something violent with that gun that\\nthe crime occurs.  Of course, it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to\\npossess a gun, but we don\\'t feel it is right to treat common citizens\\nwho have lived good lives as if they were just \"pre-felons\" waiting to\\ncommit crimes.\\n\\n> We shouldn\\'t mix weapons and items that can serve as one....\\n\\nI don\\'t understand this sentence.\\n\\n> IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.\\n> But should it have to be like that ??\\n\\nLife isn\\'t fair.  I shouldn\\'t need a fire extinguisher either, or\\nflood and theft insurance, or to lock the doors of my house and car.\\nBut pining for a better world won\\'t do anything to address what I have\\nto do to live in this one.\\n\\n> Do you think it\\'s wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??\\n\\nNone of ours, I\\'m sure.\\n\\n> If you believe it\\'s smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think\\n> it should be free to buy guns ??\\n\\nFrankly, I\\'m not sure I know what good a driver\\'s license does anyone,\\neither.  The people who drive safely never use it, and the people who \\ndrive drunk, drive without it!\\n\\nHowever, a car is a good tool, but not one that protects my right to life.\\nI rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely.\\n\\n> I\\'m not a pacifist or anti gun. \\n> I would defend my home, loved ones and country, but I don\\'t view guns as\\n> neccities or toys.\\n> I HAVE done army service, and HAVE used a variaty of weapons, but wouldn\\'t\\n> want to have one for self defence or because they \\'feel good\\'....\\n\\nThe question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally.

The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV\\nIn order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than\\nthat.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect\\ninside a PC.\\n\\nBefore you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low\\ndistortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  Digital\\nDomain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitized\\nwaveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on\\nthe spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design.\\n(That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed\\n- I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)\\n\\nIf you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking at\\nthe MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) complete\\nsampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and it\\nuses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated\\nfrom the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog design\\nguide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77db\\nmax (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces\\n\\nA evaluation kit is available.  Might want to give these nice folks a\\ncall.  1-800-998-8800 or fax: (408)737-7194 and (408) 737-7600 ext4000\\nfor application assistance.\\n\\nThis assumes that you can build your own DAS and write your own software.\\n(Hey you can get the MAX121 as a free sample just by calling the 1-800 #)\\n\\n>I would appreciate discussion of your personal experience with a Mac or PC-\\n>based ADC system.\\n\\nI would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out\\nof your system by looking at the noise level, otherwise you might be\\nthrowing out your money.\\n\\n>Charles Cunningham\\n>cec@imager.llnl.gov\\n\\nK.

If\\nyou are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will\\nnot be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. \\nThe fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle\\n(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of\\nthe law is no excuse - they will get you too!\\n\\nIt used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for\\nan officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many\\nlaw enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. \\nRight, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF\\nfrom the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was \"no way!\" \\nBut, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police\\nare writing citations right and left for people using radar\\ndetectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had\\nfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,\\nand he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was\\nthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.\\n\\nNow, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or\\nnear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me\\nfrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my\\nspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar\\ndetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which\\nis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to\\nobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.\\n\\nFor my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only\\nworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave\\nenlightment may be necessary.\\n\\nSo, the questions are -\\n  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?\\n  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by\\n  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector\\n  antenna?\\n  Are any brands \"quieter\" than others?\\n\\n==============================================================================\\nRandy T.

Thanks to all of you that\\nreplied.\\n\\n\\n> 1) The card does not work in a system with 32M RAM.\\n\\na) The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only, as far as I know.  The VLB\\n   and EISA version should have no problems.\\n \\nb) I\\'m pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn\\'t\\n   work in systems with over 16M Ram.  There is supposed to be way\\n   of switching the \"memory aperture\" feature off to prevent this,\\n   but apparently it doesn\\'t work.  I posted some \"help me\" messages\\n   on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn\\'t have this\\n   problem.\\n\\nc) FALSE\\n\\nd) The VLB card, which I have, allows you to set memory aperture over 32M\\n   by using their configuration software.  No messing with jumpers necessary.\\n\\n   The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards.\\n\\n\\n> 2) The card works in a 32M system with some switches\\n>    set but it is much slower.\\n\\na) Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM\\n   (EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you. \\n \\nb) Dunno.\\n\\nc) Depends on the bus. YES if ISA, NO if EISA or Localbus\\n\\n\\n> 3) The card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes.\\n\\na) Nope.  I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all\\n   non-interlaced.\\n\\nb) Yes - According to PC Magazine, they\\'ve tested a local bus version\\n   that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced.\\n\\nc) Not for the Pro. Sometimes for the Plus.\\n\\n   Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to \\n   do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color\\n   and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding.\\n\\n\\n> 4) The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many\\n>    cases.\\n\\na) They aren\\'t perfect, but are much improved.  I don\\'t recall the last time which\\n   I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due\\n   to software incompatibility.\\n\\nb) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.\\n\\nc) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain\\n   graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they\\n   do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..\\n   other accelerated cards also have bugs.\\n\\nd) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than\\n   satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my\\n   NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.\\n\\n   I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond\\n   Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on\\n   the old driver.\\n\\n\\n> 5) This card is the fastest full colour card for the money.\\n\\na) It\\'s quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.\\n \\nb) Yes - I\\'ll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what\\n   I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)\\n   every 20 minutes or so...\\n\\nc) Depends on many many things.\\n\\n\\n> 6) This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-)\\n\\na) I like it.\\n\\nb) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.\\n\\nc) Yes, this appears to be true :-)\\n\\nd) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are\\n   coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.\\n   Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer \\n   at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was \\n   developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)\\n\\n   Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.\\n \\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThat is the end of the questions. These were the most discussed items in this\\ngroup so I thought they needed confirmation. For those of you not familiar\\nwith the card I have included a summary here (from an ATI ad since I don\\'t have\\nan Graphics Ultra yet.)\\n\\nATI Graphics Ultra Plus:\\n- Accelerated 1024x768 at 65K colours\\n- True colour(16.7M) at 800x600\\n- Multimedia Video Acceleration (for Indeo Video,RLE and Video 1 compressed)\\n  Stretch full motion video windows to full size\\n- Fast VGA\\n- Includes 3 button mouse (ISA versions only)\\n- Anti-aliased fonts (ed. avail in 16 colour mode only,I think)\\n- Real-time pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop\\n- Around a 1/2 length card size\\n- Priced from $400 U.S.\\n\\nATI Graphics Ultra Pro:\\n- Everything in Graphics Ultra Plus\\n- Faster performance with VRAMS\\n- Accelerated 1280x1024 at 256 colours 74Hz non-interlaced\\n- Available in ISA, EISA and Microchannel\\n- Priced from $600 U.S.\\n\\nATI Technologies\\n(416) 756-0718\\n\\nI hope this summary can be of use to you.\\n\\nAl\\n\\nP.S.

Maybe\\n\\nPC Magazine, January 12, 1993 had a review of several personal finance\\nmanagement programe, as did PC-Computing, January 1993.  PC World,\\nDecember 1992 also had articles about Quicken and Managing Your Money.\\nI can email you copies of these articles if you can\\'t find them at your\\nlibrary.\\n\\nI\\'ve been using Managing Your Money for several years, and I have\\nseveral friends who use Quicken, though I\\'ve not used it myself.  My\\noverall impression is that Quicken is a financial accounts manager\\nwhile Managing Your Money will help you more completely manage your\\nfinances.\\n\\nHere are some features that I believe Managing Your Money and Quicken share:\\n\\n\\tThe ability to keep records for each of your financial accounts:\\n\\tchecking, savings, charge, cash, or brokerage.  You can reconcile\\n\\tyour account statements with the records the program keeps.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to make a budget and track your spending against that\\n\\tbudget.\\n\\n\\tA Checkfree module which will allow you to use the Checkfree bill\\n\\tpaying service to pay your bills via your modem.\\n\\t\\n\\tThe ability to print checks on your printer.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to keep loan records and set up automatic loan payments.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to import stock quotations to keep your brokerage accounts\\n\\tup to date.  I know Managing Your Money can do this automatically\\n\\tvia modem.  Quicken probably can as well, but I\\'m not sure about it.\\n\\n\\tThe ability to export tax information to popular tax preparation\\n\\tprograms.\\n\\n\\nHere are some features that I believe Managing Your Money has that\\nQuicken does not:\\n\\n\\tA tax prediction module.  This looks at your accounts and budget to\\n\\tpredict your tax liability for the coming year.  It\\'s usefull to fine\\n\\ttune your withholding so Uncle Sam doesn\\'t get his due too early.\\n\\n\\tAn insurance and vital records module.  This is a place to keep\\n\\trecords of your insurance policies as well as other vital records.\\n\\tIt can also compute your life expectancy.\\n\\n\\tA financial analysis module.  This computes compound interest, \\n\\teffects of inflation, loan payments term or interest, yield to\\n\\tmaturity for bonds, savings account yields, days between dates, and\\n\\tloan amortization schedules.  It also has functions to help you \\n\\tdecide whether to refinance your mortgage, whether you can afford\\n\\ta particular home, whether a particular rental property is a good\\n\\tinvestment, whether you should buy lease or rent, and whether\\n\\ta particular investment\\'s cash flow is adequate for your situation.\\n\\tThis module can also help you plan for retirement and for helping\\n\\tyour kids with their tuition.  \\n\\n\\tA net worth module.  This is a place to record all your assets\\n\\tand liabilities.  Your net worth can be computed from this \\n\\tinformation.  Any assets or liabilities recorded in other modules\\n\\tare automatically included here.\\n\\n\\tA \"desk\" module.  This includes a small word processor, a card file\\n\\tyou can use to store names, addresses, phone numbers and other vital\\n\\tinformation about friends and associates, a perpetual calander, a\\n\\trudimentary calculator, a to-do list, a reminder list, an appointment\\n\\tlist, and a place to record your phone calls (for those who need to\\n\\ttrack such things).  Your appointments, reminders and to-do list\\n\\tcan be made to display automatically when you start the program.\\n\\nThere are probably some things listed above that Quicken has, but I\\'m almost\\nsure that Quicken doesn\\'t do everything I\\'ve listed.  If I\\'m wrong, I\\'m sure\\nhordes of Quicken devotees will flame me to a crisp.\\n\\nOne thing that Quicken has that Managing Your Money does not yet have is a \\nWindows version.  MECA software is rumored to be working on a Windows version\\nof Managing Your Money for release late this year.\\n\\nI hope this information is of use to you.  I\\'ve found Managing Your Money to\\nbe a very usefull program for keeping my financial records.  On the other hand\\nI know many people who are equally as happy with Quicken.  If Quicken has all\\nthe features you need or want, I\\'d go with it. If you find any of the Managing\\nYour Money features that Quicken doesn\\'t have to be useful, I think it\\'s well\\nworth the price.\\n'},\n",

In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the\\neyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts\\nnow rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing\\npeople for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and\\nAnnias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His\\nplan might be accomplished.\\n    But don\\'t forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to\\nexecute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to\\nfulfill the chorus of \"Let his blood be upon our hands\" of the crowd in\\nJersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel,\\nwhich was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish\\nother nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. \\nDon\\'t you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, \"Mene, mene,\\ntekel, peres?\"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God\\'s\\njustice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians\\nas their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the\\nextirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. \\nThe Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and\\nthe Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go\\non with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is\\nquite clear.\\nTwo things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to\\nquestion why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom,\\nHe made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans\\n9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of\\nJesus Christ is as follows: \"Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at\\nhand.\"  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - \"Let\\nthe dead bury the dead, come, follow me.\"  There is not an infinite\\namount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to\\nfollow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, \"well, alright,\\nyou can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your\\nplans.\"  He said \"Follow me.\"  His message is NOT \"I\\'m just a sweety-pie\\nwho would never hurt a fly, you\\'ve got all the time in the world, and\\nDivine Judgement, that\\'s only a fairy tale.\"  \"Our great God and Savior\"\\nJesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the\\nworld.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be\\nquestioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.\\n\\nD. Andrew Byler\\n\"Does not He who ways the heart perceive [sin], and will He not judge\\nmen according to their works?\" - Proverbs 24.12\\n'},\n",

EDT\\n             \\n             \\n             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to\\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\\nbroadcast with the American people. \\n             \\n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\\nyear's campaign.\\n             \\n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\\n             \\n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\\nbusiness.  \\n             \\n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\\nfalling behind.\\n             \\n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\\ncost of health care.\\n             \\n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\\nplaces to live.\\n             \\n             In many critical products today Americans are the\\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\\n             \\n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\\n             \\n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \\nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\\n             \\n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \\nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \\n             \\n             I know the American people are tired of business as\\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \\n             \\n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\\nportion of our original goals.\\n             \\n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\\ncreating jobs.\\n             \\n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\\npercent.\\n             \\n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\\nand deserve it.\\n             \\n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\\nCongress this year.\\n             \\n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\\nAmerican people to work.  \\n             \\n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\\nare -- on people or on politics.  \\n             \\n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\\n             \\n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\\nfor over the life of our budget.\\n             \\n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\\n             \\n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.\\n\\n                               END                 10:11 A.M.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\n   the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\n   law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\n   industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\n   Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\n   protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\n   protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\n   technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\n   unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\n   by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\n   A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\n   been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\n   new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\n   relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\n   an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\n   using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\n   commercial use today.\\n\\n   This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\n   information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\n   and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\n   electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\n   ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\n   intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\n   A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n   \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\n   Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   2\\n\\n\\n   \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\n   agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\n   device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\n   in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\n   Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\n   government officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\n   wiretap.\\n\\n   The \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\n   new authorities to access the content of the private\\n   conversations of Americans.\\n\\n   To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\n   Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\n   devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\n   government will be offered access to the confidential details of\\n   the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\n   their findings.\\n\\n   The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\n   encryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\n   privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\n   criminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\n   approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\n   to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\n   to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\n   trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\n   the President has directed government agencies to develop a\\n   comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n\\t--   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n\\t     employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n\\t--   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n\\t     calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n\\t     order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n\\t--   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n\\t     technology to build the National Information\\n\\t     Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n\\t     the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n\\t     marketplace; and \\n\\n\\t--   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n\\t     high technology products.\\n\\n   The President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\n   affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\n   privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   3\\n\\n   The Administration is committed to working with the private\\n   sector to spur the development of a National Information\\n   Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\n   technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\n   information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n   (\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\n   programming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\n   system transmits voice.\\n\\n   Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\n   role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\n   quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\n   its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\n   protect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\n   them from those who break the law.\\n\\n   Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\n   The provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\n   encryption technology are also available.  \\n\\n   For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\n   Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n   ---------------------------------\\n\\n\\n   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\n   TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n\\tagencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\n   A:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n\\tno new authorities to access the content of the private\\n\\tconversations of Americans.\\n\\n   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n\\ta drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n\\tencrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n\\tdecipher the message?\\n\\n   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n\\tcourt order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n\\twould then present documentation of this authorization to\\n\\tthe two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n\\tobtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n\\tsmugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n\\tstored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n\\tescrow system.\\n\\n   Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\n   A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n\\tentities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n\\tAdministration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n\\toversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\n   Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n\\thow strong the security is?  \\n\\n   A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n\\tsystems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n\\tremain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n\\tsystem, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n\\tcryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n\\tpotential users that there are no unrecognized\\n\\tvulnerabilities.\\n\\n   Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\n   A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n\\tCommerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n\\tthis decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n\\tPresident, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n\\tofficials.\\n\\n   Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\n   A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n\\tencryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n\\tas we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n\\tbriefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n\\tdecisions related to this initiative.\\n\\n   Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\n   A:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n\\tencryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n\\tmicrocircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n\\tmanufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n\\tmanufacturer that produces them.\\n\\n   Q:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\n   A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n\\tCalifornia, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n\\tmanufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n\\tto other vendors in the future.\\n\\n   Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\n   A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n\\tthe \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n\\n   Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n\\tsolution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n\\twilling to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n\\tpowerful encryption devices?\\n\\n   A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n\\tconsidered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n\\tmechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n\\tthat is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n\\tthan others readily available today, but it is just one\\n\\tpiece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n\\tencryption technology, which the Administration is\\n\\tdeveloping.\\n\\n\\tThe Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n\\tthreatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n\\twe will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n\\teffectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n\\tAmerican, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n\\tunbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n\\tfalse \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n\\tan \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n\\tand in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n\\tbalanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n\\tChip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\n   Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n\\tAdministration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n\\tthat of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\n   A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n\\ttechnology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n\\tcommitted to working with industry and public-interest\\n\\tgroups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n\\tprivacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n\\tenforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n\\tand terrorism.\\n\\n   Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n\\tthe government hardware?\\n\\n   A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n\\trequirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n\\trequired to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n\\tsame is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n\\tattractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n\\tto U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n\\tin mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n\\tcase-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n\\tdevices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n\\tto review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n\\tof these products.\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

I assume its an idiom and cannot\\n>>be defined by its separate terms.\\n \\n>>Give it a try.\\n \\n>Objective morality is morality built from objective values.\\n \\nFrom A Dictionary of Philosophy, by Anthony Flew:\\n \\n\"Objectivism:  The belief that there are certain moral truths that would\\nremain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired.  For\\ninstance, \\'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another\\nsimply to take pleasure in his suffering\\' might be thought of as a\\nplausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the\\ncontention remains true, just as \\'5 + 7 = 12\\' remains correct even if\\nthere is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to\\ndetermine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be\\nestablished.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what\\nis but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then\\nthey cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor\\ncan they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding\\ncontent;  \\'One ought always to do the right thing\\' is plainly true in\\nvirtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to\\naction (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may\\ntalk of \\'self-evident truths\\', but can he deny the subjectivist\\'s claim\\nthat self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left\\nof the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may\\nwell feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements\\nwith which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion\\nis, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to have\\npreferences regarding human activity.\"\\n \\nDavid Nye (nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu).

So, what do you think is the \"meaning behind\", \\n\\tthe intention and the effect when an \"army\" purposely \\n\\t*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look \\n\\tlike civilians\\'? *They are judging that the benefit they will \\n\\treceive from this \"cover\" is more important that the harm\\n\\tthat will come to civilians.*\\n\\nThis is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying\\nthat the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians\\nin \"the middle\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart\\nfrom civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower\\nthe risk to civilians.\\n\\n\\tBut if the guerillas do this aren\\'t *they* putting themselves\\n\\tat greater risk?

By your\\ncriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.\\n\\nThat is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for \\nthe \"interim\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are\\ndemanding conditions that essentially define \"autonomy\" already.

In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated\\npredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This \\ncompletely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 \\ncould do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I\\'d\\ntake that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to\\nthe data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.\\n\\nI\\'ve started with team data, using data from the Elias\\'s that\\nI\\'ve picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and\\nb) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias\\'s profits.\\nThat gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don\\'t \\nhave team RBIs for \\'87 or I could add that year.)  If you\\nrun a simple least squares fit to the data you get \\n\\n(RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.\\n\\nThe correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is\\nsignificant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the\\nfit is good at the team level.  I\\'ve no started to move on to \\nthe player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,\\nOzzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to \\nadd quite a few more during my copious free time this year.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the\\nlow HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it\\ncould just be Ozzie.

If it is only\\nused for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file\\nencryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced\\nstandard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to\\neasy-to-break inverters.\\n\\nNote that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap.\\nBefore we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for\\ne-mail and files, let\\'s focus on this.\\n\\nOne question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is\\nlimited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.\\n\\nThough I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal\\nless threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no\\nsecure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a \"goat\" can\\neavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and\\ncordless phones.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nReading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure\\nwithout access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses\\nconfronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese\\nsecurity services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make\\navailable some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.\\n\\nMost legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to\\nhave a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of\\ndepositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable\\nescrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the\\nweek, and that system has worked pretty well.\\n\\nFrom my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that\\nneed to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in\\nreturn we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES\\nand other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly\\nskilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be\\nchecked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn\\'t have to\\nbe, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys\\npursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate\\ncommunications against economic adversaries, while still being able to\\neavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.\\n\\n------\\n\\nIn discussing this, let\\'s try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and\\nnoise of some previous threads. This is a substantive and technical issue,\\nand personal remarks have no place in such a discussion.\\n\\n-- \\nDavid Sternlight         Great care has been taken to ensure the accuracy of\\n                         our information, errors and omissions excepted.  \\n\\n\\n'},\n",

Larson\\'s comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \\n          space and time: \\n    \\n               (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" \\n    \\n               (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" \\n    \\n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \\n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \\n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \\n          (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL \\n          DATUM\"). \\n      \\n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \\n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \\n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \\n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \\n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \\n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \\n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \\n          BURSTS). \\n          \\n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \\n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \\n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \\n          matter. \\n\\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \\n          complex mathematics, in his books. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          BOOKS of Dewey B.

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \\n          organization that was started to promote Larson\\'s Theory.  \\n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \\n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \\n\\n          \\n\\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s Background\\n    \\n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \\n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \\n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \\n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \\n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \\n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \\n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \\n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \\n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \\n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \\n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \\n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \\n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \\n     \\n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \\n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \\n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \\n          researchers\\' experimental and observational data.  And in \\n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \\n    \\n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \\n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \\n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \\n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \\n    \\n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \\n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\\'s books are FULL of \\n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \\n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \\n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \\n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \\n    \\n    \\n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \\n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\\'s Theory, and was (or \\n          still is) President of Larson\\'s organization, \"THE \\n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \\n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \\n          Minneapolis after retiring. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\\n          \\n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \\n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \\n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \\n          value. \\n    \\n               Most physicists don\\'t realize it, but, according to the \\n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \\n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \\n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \\n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \\n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \\n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \\n          with their environment. \\n    \\n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \\n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \\n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \\n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \\n    \\n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \\n          BILLION cost?!!  Don\\'t we have much more important uses for \\n          this WASTED money?! \\n    \\n     \\n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \\n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \\n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \\n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \\n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \\n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \\n    \\n          \\n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \\n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \\n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \\n      \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\\n          \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \\n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \\n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \\n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \\n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \\n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \\n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \\n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \\n          other. \\n      \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \\n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \\n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \\n          MATERIAL half. \\n       \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\\n          \\n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \\n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \\n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \\n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \\n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \\n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \\n          help \"prove\" Einstein\\'s \"General Theory of Relativity\". \\n    \\n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \\n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \\n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \\n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \\n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \\n    \\n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \\n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \\n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \\n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \\n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \\n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \\n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \\n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \\n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \\n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \\n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \\n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \\n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \\n          about this.] \\n    \\n     \\n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \\n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \\n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \\n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \\n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\\'s Theory, \\n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \\n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \\n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \\n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \\n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \\n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \\n          FANTASY). \\n    \\n                                    \\n          \\n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\n\\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \\n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \\n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \\n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \\n    \\n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \\n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \\n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \\n    \\n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \\n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \\n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \\n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \\n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \\n    \\n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \\n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \\n          OPEN MINDS! \\n    \\n               The following is an example of his Theory\\'s success: \\n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \\n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \\n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \\n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\'s \\n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \\n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \\n    \\n\\n \\n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\\n\\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \\n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \\n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \\n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \\n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \\n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \\n          directional coincidence). \\n    \\n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \\n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \\n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \\n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \\n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \\n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \\n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \\n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \\n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \\n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \\n          directions uniformly.) \\n    \\n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \\n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \\n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \\n          stop it! \\n    \\n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \\n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \\n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\\n          \\n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \\n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \\n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \\n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \\n    \\n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \\n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \\n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \\n          B. Larson. \\n    \\n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \\n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \\n          and in some of his other books. \\n    \\n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \\n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \\n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \\n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \\n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \\n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\\'s internal \\n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \\n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \\n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \\n          lighter elements. \\n    \\n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \\n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \\n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \\n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \\n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \\n          of his books [better than I can]. \\n    \\n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \\n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \\n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \\n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \\n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \\n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \\n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \\n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \\n    \\n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \\n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \\n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \\n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \\n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \\n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \\n          Diagram. \\n    \\n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \\n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \\n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \\n          system, orbiting each other. \\n     \\n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \\n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \\n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \\n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \\n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\\n\\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \\n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \\n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \\n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \\n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \\n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \\n      \\n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \\n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \\n          his own version of Bode\\'s Law. \\n          \\n\\n\\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\\n\\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \\n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \\n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \\n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \\n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \\n    \\n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \\n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \\n          holes\", etc.! \\n    \\n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s books about \\n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \\n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \\n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \\n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \\n          to \"prove\" their theory. \\n    \\n    \\n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \\n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \\n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\\'s severe physical \\n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \\n    \\n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \\n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\\'s \\n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \\n          Unified Science). \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\\n\\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \\n          with UFO\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \\n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \\n    \\n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \\n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \\n          Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \\n    \\n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \\n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \\n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \\n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \\n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson\\'s book \"NOTHING BUT \\n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \\n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \\n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \\n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \\n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \\n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \\n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \\n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \\n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \\n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \\n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \\n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \\n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \\n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \\n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \\n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \\n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \\n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \\n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \\n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \\n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \\n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \\n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \\n          \\n               Note that in Larson\\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are \\n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \\n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \\n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \\n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \\n          according to Larson\\'s Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \\n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \\n    \\n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \\n          light! \\n    \\n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \\n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \\n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \\n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \\n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson\\'s Theory, an electrical charge \\n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \\n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \\n          rotation of the particle.) \\n      \\n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \\n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \\n          generated in clouds. \\n\\n\\n\\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\\n\\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has \\n          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in \\n          his first book \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\". \\n    \\n               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, \\n          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call \\n          \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as \\n          the \"scientific\" literature and the \"education\" systems, to \\n          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson\\'s Theory has they have. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s Theory has excellent explanations for many \\n          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such \\n          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY \\n          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, \\n          in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles \\n          of Larson\\'s Theory should be included in all related courses \\n          at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and \\n          elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a \\n          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed. \\n    \\n          \\n\\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \\n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson\\'s BOOKS). \\n\\n\\n\\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \\n          IMPORTANT partial summary is ENCOURAGED. \\n\\n\\n                                       Robert E.

Do the gases really \\n>compress that much?\\n\\n    For discussion purposes, I will ignore dynamic effects like pulses\\nin the exhaust pipe, and try to paint a useful mental picture.\\n\\n1.  Unless an engine is supercharged, the pressure available to force\\nair into the intake tract is _atmospheric_.  At the time the intake\\nvalve is opened, the pressure differential available to move air is only\\nthe difference between the combustion chamber pressure (left over after\\nthe exhaust stroke) and atmospheric.  As the piston decends on the\\nintake stroke, combustion chamber pressure is decreased, allowing\\natmospheric pressure to move more air into the intake tract.  At no time\\ndoes the pressure ever become \"negative\", or even approach a good\\nvacuum.\\n\\n2.  At the time of the exhaust valve closing, the pressure in the\\ncombustion chamber is essentially the pressure of the exhaust system up\\nto the first major flow restriction (the muffler).  Note that the volume\\nof gas that must flow through the exhaust is much larger than the volume\\nthat must flow through the intake, because of the temperature\\ndifference and the products of combustion.\\n\\n3.  In the last 6-8 years, the Japanese manufacturers have started\\npaying attention to exhaust and intake tuning, in pursuit of almighty\\nhorsepower.  At this point in time, on high-performance bikes,\\nsubstitution of an aftermarket free-flow air filter will have almost\\nzero affect on performance, because the stock intake system flows very\\nwell anyway.  Substitution of an aftermarket exhaust system will make\\nvery little difference, unless (in general) the new exhaust system is\\n_much_ louder than the stocker.\\n\\n4.  On older bikes,  exhaust back-pressure was the dominating factor.\\nIf free-flowing air filters were substituted, very little difference\\nwas noted, unless a free-flowing exhaust system was installed as well.\\n\\n5.  In general, an engine can be visualized as an air pump.  At any\\ngiven RPM, anything that will cause the engine to pump more air, be it\\non the intake or exhaust side, will cause it to produce more horsepower.\\nPumping more air will require recalibration (rejetting) of the carburetor.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n| Dave Tharp                      | DoD #0751   | \"You can\\'t wear out       |\\n| davet@interceptor.CDS.TEK.COM   | MRA #151    |   an Indian Scout,        |\\n| \\'88 K75S  \\'48 Indian Chief      | AHRMA #751  |  Or its brother the Chief.|\\n| \\'75 R90S(#151) \\'72 TR-2B(#751)  | AMA #524737 |  They\\'re built like rocks |\\n| \\'65 R50/2/Velorex  \\'57 NSU Max  |             |   to take the knocks,     |\\n|       1936 BMW R12              | (Compulsive | It\\'s the Harleys that     |\\n| My employer has no idea.        |   Joiner)   |   give you grief.\"        |\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n'},\n",

Just after\\nI completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight training\\nday and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end of\\nthe 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold, turned pale,\\nand lost 60% of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasn't that\\nheavy, I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a few \\nminutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with\\nchest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  But\\nI dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continued\\narm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do my\\nusual hour on the ski machine either.  I'll take it easy for the rest of\\nthe day.\\n\\nMy arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal --\\nmy hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normal\\nand it is no longer cold. \\n\\nHorrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through\\nmy brain.  I'm 34, vegetarian, and pretty fit from my daily exercise\\nregimen.  So that can't be it.

Polymenakos) writes:\\n\\n> Well, ZUMABOT claims just the opposite: That Greeks are not allowing\\n>Turks to exit the country. Now, explain this: The number of Turks in\\n>Thrace has steadily risen from 50,000 in 23 to 80,000, while the Greeks of\\n\\nDr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally \\nbe believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing \\nGoebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks \\nwho are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's \\ninformed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For \\ninstance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they \\nwatched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can \\nread the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what \\nreally happened. \\n\\nThere are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee \\nAlumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, \\nthe Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, \\nthe Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek \\nMen's Lycee Foundation.  \\n\\nAs for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' \\nin titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts \\nhave ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, \\nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \\nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \\nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \\nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\\n\\nIn the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish\\nparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment\\nwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was\\nof Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official\\nwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three \\nyears. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than \\na vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority \\ncomplex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. \\n\\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' \\nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \\nto 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \\nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \\nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \\nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \\nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \\nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \\naccording to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'\\n\\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \\nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \\nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \\ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\\n\\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \\nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \\nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \\nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \\nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \\nof historical monuments. \\n\\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \\nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \\nHellenizing the region.\\n\\nAnd you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human \\nRights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by \\nthe Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation \\nof the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, \\nSidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of \\nKefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. \\nHis employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in \\n24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his \\ninvolvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice \\nand remains without a job. \\n\\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \\nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \\nfindings were published in a report titled \\n\\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\\n\\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \\nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \\nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \\nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \\nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \\nLausanne Convention. \\n\\nThe Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik\\nwere attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in\\nKarotas was razed by bulldozers.\\n\\nShall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going \\nto take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The \\ndiscussion of human rights violations in Greece does not \\nstop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles \\nI shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks\\nin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration \\nhas an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made \\nplans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it \\nhas to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on \\nconventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek \\nand Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned \\nto take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the \\ntransfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern \\nCyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of \\nthe agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.\\n\\nAn acceptable method may certainly be found when there\\nis a will. But we know of various kinds of violent\\nbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning\\nof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were \\ndragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. \\nShots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.\\n\\nNow wait, there is more.\\n\\n  'Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited\\n  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by\\n  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,\\n  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).\\n\\n  pages 82-83:\\n\\n<< 1.

Rather, it appears that\\nprice controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of\\nservice and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide \\ncomparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply\\nmake less on each treatment than they would have if the price had \\nrisen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.\\n\\nThere is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD \\nsubstantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday\\npredictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction\\nof service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears\\nthat in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers \\nare government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.  \\n(RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to\\nSeattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)  \\n\\nThe bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government \\nintervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial\\nresults for both providers and consumers.  Claims that \"government\\nbureaucracy\" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace\\nshould take such such cases into account.\\n\\njsh\\n\\n>\\n>=Mark\\n--\\nSteve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   \\n\"One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh\\n the bulls**t.\" - R.

Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of\\n            Jesus, and let them go.\\n\\nACT 5:41    The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been\\n            counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.\\n\\nIt appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion\\nto even hearing Jesus\\'s name.\\nACT 5:28    \"We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,\" he said.\\n            \"Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are\\n            determined to make us guilty of this man\\'s blood.\"\\n\\nFinally, the first apostle\\'s death, James of Zebedee was certainly\\nnot by Rome\\'s hand any more than the first martyr Stephen. \\n\\n\\n>The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different\\n>forms in the religions of antiquity.

Lumpkin III)\\nSubject: HELP - SCSI Woes on Mac IIfx\\nKeywords: SCSI, IIfx\\nOrganization: NASA Ames Research Center \\nLines: 46\\n\\nI am having trouble with SCSI on a Mac IIfx. The machine is 3 years old\\nand I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) for\\ntwo and a half years. The disk recently crashed. I reformatted (Silverlining\\n5.42), but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing.\\nThe error message reported was like:\\n\\nSector 0: Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out.\\n\\nThis occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect the\\ndiagnostic's reference to Sector 0 ??? ). On the third reformat and after\\nreinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes\\n2,3, and 4 with no errors. (Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors,\\nbut still mapped out no sectors.) I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall\\nSystem 7 and reload my data from a backup. This proceded normally; however,\\nI now have sub-optimal performance. Symptoms include:\\n\\n   o Frequent crashes\\n   o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to\\n       correct.\\n   o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot.\\n       - If I boot from Norton Utl. after this occurs, it cannot find the\\n         disk either.\\n       - The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power. It sometimes\\n         requires several attempts.\\n\\nQUESTIONS:\\n\\n   1) Has anyone had this type of problem before?\\n   2) Is the problem with the fx motherboard (And its non-standard\\n      SCSI implementation) or with my Maxtor Disk? Is there some\\n      diagnostic software that would help me make this determination?\\n   3) Is it a termination problem? I currently have external Syquest\\n      and an external DataFrame XP60 on the chain. The XP60 is at the\\n      end, and has internal termination; so I am not using the IIfx\\n      terminator. I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal\\n      drive. I have run with this exact steup for 2 1/2 years with\\n      one previous disk crash requiring a reformat (about a year ago).\\n      I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices;\\n      so I don't see how SCSI termination would now be an issue. Of\\n      course who knows :-<\\n\\nHelp would be much appreciated.\\n\\nForrest E. Lumpkin III\\nNASA Ames Research Center\\nlumpkin@corvus.arc.nasa.gov\\n\"},\n",

EDT\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal\\nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law\\nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled\\nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.\\nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day\\nstandoff ensued.\\n\\n     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every\\nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without\\nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were\\nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were\\ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably\\ninsane.\\n\\n     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both\\nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,\\nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the\\naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination\\ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no\\nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal\\nagents against the compound.\\n\\n     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on\\nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on\\nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.\\nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even\\nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause\\npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people\\nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\\n\\n     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I\\ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I\\nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what\\nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the\\nimplementation of the decision.\\n\\n     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.\\nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal\\nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his\\ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not\\nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate\\nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\\n\\n     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the\\nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and\\nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to\\nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been\\ndne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent\\nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I\\nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required\\nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to\\ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can\\ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\\n\\n     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney\\nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the\\nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult\\ncircumstances.\\n\\n     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry\\nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end\\nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be\\ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David\\nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over\\nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult\\nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will\\nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future\\nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what\\nhas been learned now.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,\\nafter 51 days, you decided --\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is\\nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation\\nwith --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go\\nfirst and then the other.\\n\\n     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I\\ncan't do it at once.\\n\\n     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about\\nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General\\nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another\\nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she\\ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted\\nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause\\npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it\\nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was\\nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.\\n\\n     I was further told that under no circumstances would our\\npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to\\nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and\\nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful\\nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.\\nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\\n\\n     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I\\nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons\\nI was given were the following:\\n\\n     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\\nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the\\nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\\nneeded in other parts of the country.\\n\\n     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\\nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\\nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\\nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\\nmembers to come out.\\n\\n     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\\nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\\nthe passage of time.\\n\\n     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\\nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused\\nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\\nunsafe conditions.\\n\\n     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\\nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\\ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\\nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\\nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\\nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\\nincrease with the passage of time.\\n\\n     The third question I asked was, has the military been\\nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\\nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\\nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\\npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\\nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\\nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\\nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one\\nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military\\n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming\\nsignificance.\\n\\n     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I\\nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she\\nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that\\ntoday.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\\n\\n     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --\\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were\\ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only\\nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only\\nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to\\nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather\\nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who\\nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into\\ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events\\nto unfold.\\n\\n     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people\\nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General\\non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.\\nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry\\nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it\\nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that\\nhappen when the federal government is in control.\\n\\n     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised\\nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the\\nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics\\nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)\\n\\n     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this\\nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These\\npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were\\nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,\\nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to\\navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate\\nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the\\nchildren.\\n\\n     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,\\nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you\\nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why\\nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she\\nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those\\nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly\\nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier\\nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for\\nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\\n\\n     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was\\nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of\\npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really\\ndecide that way?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume\\nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has\\ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of\\ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the\\nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry\\nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we\\nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have\\nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say\\nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make\\nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want\\nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have\\nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but\\ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best\\nevidence we have.\\n\\n     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of\\nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it\\nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,\\nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is\\nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the\\npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options\\npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from\\nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all\\nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go\\nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good\\njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued\\nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them\\nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of\\nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to\\nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the\\nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things\\njust began to spin downward.\\n\\n     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened\\nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not\\ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with\\nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they\\nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get\\npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.\\nThat's what they thought.\\n\\n     Q  Did the government know that the children did not\\nhave gas masks?\\n\\n     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are\\nyou in agreement with that?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do\\nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the\\nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring\\nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any\\ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully\\ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the\\nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the\\ncountry.\\n\\n   (more, more)\\n -30-\\n\"},\n",

Andrew Byler)\\nSubject: Re: What WAS the immaculate conception\\nOrganization: Freshman, Civil Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA\\nLines: 48\\n\\nBiblical basis for the Immaculate Conception:\\n\\n1) \"I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and\\nbetween your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall crush\\nyour head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel.\"\\n    -Genesis 3.15\\n\\n2) \"He who commits sin is of the devil ...\"\\n    -1 John 3.8\\n\\n3) \"Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with thee ...\"\\n    -Luke 1.28\\n\\n   From the above, we prove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.\\n   First, God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15, which is the\\nfirst promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles of\\nSatan. \"[Satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in\\nthe truth because there is no truth in him.\" John 8.44.  Now the\\nproto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and \"the\\nwoman\", and enmity between Satan and \"her seed.\"  Now the woman is both\\nEve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. \\n\"Her seed\" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the\\nsame way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as\\nwe do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that\\nMary is also sinless because if she wasn\\'t she would 1) not be at enmity\\nwith the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her\\nsinlessness to Christ\\'s sinlessness would be called into question, as\\nwould God\\'s veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the\\nserpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.\\n    Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the\\nArchangle Gabriel \"full of grace.\"  As I pointed out above this is from\\nthe Greek word \"Kecharitomene\" which means not just full of grace, but a\\nplenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by\\nthe footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, \"Hail you who have been and reamin\\nfilled with grace.\"  But that is a little to long to say, so it is\\nreduced to full of grace.  And as it says, \"you who have been\" Mary had\\nalways been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which\\nwas also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.\\n    It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done\\nwhat the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if\\nGod could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his\\nMother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the\\nFathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo\\n, St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of\\nChristian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on\\nthe matter in \"Ineffibilus Deus.\"\\n\\nAndy Byler\\n'},\n",

I can\\'t\\n: see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great,\\n\\nre: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93\\n\\nThis article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2\\nor DOS apps not running under Windows.\\n\\nOne of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that\\ntheir RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost\\neveryone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST)\\ndiscovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept\\nan incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry\\nerrors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or\\nFAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer\\nthan with the old 2400bps modem.\\n\\n\\nThere are three reasons for the problem:\\n\\n1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most\\n   PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the\\n   operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high\\n   interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and\\n   the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded\\n   environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can\\'t.\\n\\n2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and\\n   interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely\\n   than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you\\n   are losing data, you may be advised that \"you need to upgrade to a\\n   16550\". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance\\n   about this issue,  you\\'ll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the\\n   store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve\\n   my own problem had never heard the term \"16550\" and many didn\\'t even\\n   know what a UART was.\\n\\n3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2\\'s do), or if you can upgrade\\n   your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience\\n   errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers\\n   don\\'t take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this\\n   regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications\\n   like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem\\n   by themselves.\\n\\nIf you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of\\nthe card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid\\noverrunning it; however, I wouldn\\'t want to bet that the card designers\\nwere that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem\\ncard.  Some modem cards don\\'t even have conventional UARTs, but if they\\nare to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one.\\nUse MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.\\n\\n\\nThe Hardware Situation.\\n\\nThe UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250\\nor Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can\\'t replace\\nthem).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft\\ndiagnostic program \\\\WINDOWS\\\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before*\\nbringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from\\naccurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.\\n\\nThe Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with\\nconfigurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to\\n460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there\\'s no point in\\npushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access\\ncycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but\\nit is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info,\\nsee National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.\\n\\nSo, what UART component do you have?\\n\\nTry to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM\\nboard or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can\\'t find a socketed component with\\nthe numbers \"8250\" or \"16450\", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI,\\nand you won\\'t be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE\\nyour VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket\\nCOM board.\\n\\nIf you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in\\nNs16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several\\nsuppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The \"N\" chip is the normal 40-pin\\ndual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550\\nchips without the \"A\" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).\\n\\nEarly Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those\\nof their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various\\nIC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states\\nsupport for the following (apparently equivalent) chips:\\nNational Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552\\nChips&Technology:       82C607\\nTexas Instruments:      t16c550a\\nSilicon Systems:        73M550\\nVLSI                    16C550\\nTurboCom warns about the pre-\"A\" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550,\\nsays that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70\\nsystems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).\\n\\nIf you DON\\'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you\\'ll need to buy an after-\\nmarket COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you\\nmay be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you\\'ll need to\\neither disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to\\nCOM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).\\n\\nAlthough cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the\\nproblem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology\\nMCT-AIO+ card from:\\n\\nJDR Microdevices\\n2233 Samaritan Drive\\nSan Jose  CA  95124\\n(800) 538-5000 voice US\\n(408) 559-1200 voice other\\n(800) 538-5005 FAX US\\n\\nThe MCT-AIO+ (and the \"+\" is important) sells for $89.95.

The standard MS serial drivers don\\'t take full advantage of the\\n16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1\\ndrivers have the following limitations:\\n - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.\\n - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt\\n   rate of 10x during uploads.\\n - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it\\'s easy for 2\\n   more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).\\n - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.\\n   With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1\\n   or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would\\n   be effective.\\n - The API won\\'t accept rates above \"CBR_128000\".\\n - The API won\\'t let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even\\n   if it did, DOS programs that aren\\'t 16550-aware get little benefit\\n   from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.\\n - They don\\'t allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.\\n - The BIOS doesn\\'t initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.\\n - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don\\'t provide port\\n   speed options above 19200 bps.\\n\\nThese problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may\\nor may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0).\\nRumors suggest they \"may\" be solved in Windows \"4.0\".\\n\\nYou can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying\\na copy of \"TurboCom\", current version 1.2, from:\\n\\nBio-Engineering Research\\nPacific CommWare Division\\n180 Beacon Hill Lane\\nAshland  OR   97520-9701\\n(503) 482-2744 voice\\n(503) 482-2627 FAX\\n(503) 482-2633 BBS\\nMCImail:    344-5374\\nCompuServe: 71521,760\\n\\nPrice was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit\\ncards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom\\nbut as far as I know, they don\\'t stock it.  Bio is not a software company\\nper se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for\\nan in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a\\nmarket for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They\\nrecently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.\\n\\nI now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my\\ndatacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely\\nsee transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps\\nwhen linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O.\\nUploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts\\nare still using antique UARTs and drivers.\\n\\nNote that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu\\nin Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets\\naround this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will\\nset the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the\\nWindows APIs and dialog boxes.\\n\\nI also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you\\ndo the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is\\nnot a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC)\\nstandard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another\\n16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving\\nsystem or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough\\nto let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm\\nengineer has informed me that the 16550\\'s can\\'t really do CTS/RTS all\\nby itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above\\n115,200 may still be risky.\\n\\nEven with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still\\nexperience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and\\nserious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to\\nbuy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a\\n16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of\\nTurboCom, can be found in the Feb\\'93 issue of \"Windows Sources\" magazine.\\nI suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with\\nprocess priorities and time slices if you are a \"power user\" whose\\nthrashing system still runs into comm problems.\\n\\n\\nClosing Soapbox Comments\\n\\nThe state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across\\nthe computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface,\\nthe job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be\\nassigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer\\ncompanies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years\\nbehind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation\\nvendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the\\ninitial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was\\nsubsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the\\nexception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent\\nI/O.\\n\\nYou may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this\\nsituation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect\\ncries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs \"sort of\"\\nwork today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a\\nhardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that\\nuse that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.\\n\\nRegards,                                          1001-A East Harmony Road\\nBob Niland                                        Suite 503\\nInternet:  rjn@csn.org                            Fort Collins CO 80525\\nCompuServe: 71044,2124                            (303) 223-5209\\n\\n                     Copyright 1993 Robert J.

A \\nshort-sighted and misplaced nationalistic fervor with a wrong agenda \\nand anachronistic methods the Armenians continue to become pernicious \\nfor the region. As usual, they will be treated accordingly by their \\nneighbors. Nagorno-Karabag is a mountainous enclave that lies completely \\nwithin Azerbaijan with no border or history whatsoever connected to \\nx-Soviet Armenia. Besides the geographical aspect, Nagorno-Karabag is \\nthe historic homeland and the \\'cradle\\' of the artistic and literary \\nheritage of Azerbaijan, which renders the Armenian claims preposterous, \\neven lunatic. \\n\\nAnd we still demand:\\n\\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \\ndictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\\nKurdish people;\\n\\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for their\\nheinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n4. that all world governments officially recognize the Turkish Genocide \\nand Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian \\npolitical pressure.\\n\\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \\ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. \\n\\nNow what would you do? \\n\\nSource: \\'The Sunday Times,\\' 1 March 1992 (a British Weekly, written by \\n        Thomas Goltz, from Agdam, Azerbaijan.)\\n\\n    ARMENIAN SOLDIERS MASSACRE HUNDREDS OF FLEEING FAMILIES.\\n\\n    The spiralling  violence gripping the  outer republics of  the former\\nSoviet Union gained new impetus  yesterday with cold-blooded slaughter of\\nhundreds of women and children in war-racked Nagorno-Karabakh.\\n    Survivors  reported that  Armenian soldiers  shot and  bayoneted more\\nthan 450  Azeris, many of  them women and  children, who were  fleeing an\\nattack  on their  town. Hundreds,  possibly thousands,  were missing  and\\nfeared dead.\\n    The attackers  killed most of  the soldiers and  volunteers defending\\nthe women  and children.  They then  turned their  guns on  the terrified\\nrefugees. The few  survivors later described what  happened:\" That\\'s when\\nthe real  slaughter began,\" said  Azer Hajiev,  one of three  soldiers to\\nsurvive. \"The  Armenians just shot and  shot. And then they  came in and\\nstarted carving up people with their bayonets and knives.\"\\n    \" They were shooting, shooting, shooting\", echoed Rasia Aslanova, who\\narrived in Agdam with other women and children who made their way through\\nArmenian lines. She said her husband, Kayun, and a son-in-law were killed\\nin front of her. Her daughter was still missing.\\n    One boy who arrived in Agdam had an ear sliced off.\\n\\n    The survivors  said 2000  others, some of  whom had  fled separately,\\nwere still missing in the gruelling terrain; many could perish from their\\nwounds or the cold.\\n    By late  yesterday, 479 deaths had  been registered at the  morgue in\\nAgdam\\'s morgue,  and 29 bodies  had been buried  in the cemetery.  Of the\\nseven corpses  I saw awaiting  burial, two  were children and  three were\\nwomen, one shot through the chest at point blank range.\\n    Agdam hospital was  a scene of carnage and terror.  Doctors said they\\nhad 140 patients who escaped slaughter, most with bullet injuries or deep\\nstab wounds.\\n    Nor were they safe in Agdam. On friday night rockets fell on the city\\nwhich  has a  population  of 150,000,  destroying  several buildings  and\\nkilling one person.\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

To Christians, Hell is, by definition, \\n>eternal death--exactly what atheists are expecting when they die.\\n\\nThis is the problem. This is not hell, this is permanent death. It is\\nindeed what atheists (generally) expect and it is neither fair nor\\nunfair, it just is. You might as well argue about whether being made\\nmostly of carbon and water is \"fair\".\\n\\nHowever, the atheists who claim that Hell is unfair are talking about\\nthe fire and brimstone place of endless suffering, which necessarily\\nincludes eternal existance (life, I dunno, but some sort of continuation);\\nnot at all the same thing.\\n\\nGranted, you clearly feel that hell=death, but this is not a univeral\\nsentiment as near as I can tell.\\n\\nIf *your* idea of God \"condemns\" heathens to ordinary death, I have no\\nproblem with that. I do have a problem with the gods that hide from humans\\nand torture the unbelievers eternally for not guessing right.\\n\\n[deletia- Hell, and Literalness.]\\n\\n---\\n\\t\\t\\t- Dan Johnson\\nAnd God said \"Jeeze, this is dull\"... and it *WAS* dull.

I was\\nraised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an\\nagnostic, but recently I have developed the firm conviction that the\\nChristian message is correct and I have accepted Jesus into my life. I am\\nhappy, but I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and\\nquite possibly about what Christians should hold as true. This I am trying\\nto rectify (by reading the Bible of course), but it would be helpful\\nto also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or other\\nrelevant aspects of the Christian faith. One of my questions I would\\nlike to ask is - Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological\\nworks intended for a lay person?\\n\\nI have another question I would like to ask. I am not yet affiliated\\nwith any one congregation. Aside from matters of taste, what criteria\\nshould one use in choosing a church? I don't really know the difference\\nbetween the various Protestant denominations.\\n\\nThanks for reading my post. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSteve Hoskins\\n\\n[Aside from a commentary, you might also want to consider an\\nintroduction.  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible\\ncourses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary\\nstyles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further\\nreading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT\\nintroduction.  There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  They\\noften have background articles that are helpful.  Probably the best\\nrecommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.  (I\\nthink there may be a couple of books with this title.  This is a\\nfairly recent one, like about 1990, done in cooperation with the\\nSociety for Biblical Criticism.)  If you are committed to inerrancy,\\nyou will probably prefer something more conservative.  I don't read a\\nlot of conservative books, but a commentary I looked at by Donald\\nGuthrie looked rather good.  He has a NT Introduction, and he's also\\neditor of Eerdman's Bible Commentary.  --clh]\\n\"},\n",

       "  'content': \"From: martinh@cac.washington.EDU (Martin Hunt)\\nSubject: Announcing tcpview: A Motif-based TCP/IP protocol analyzer\\nOrganization: UW Networks and Distributed Computing\\nLines: 89\\nKeywords: protocol analyzer TCP/IP\\nTo: xannounce@expo.lcs.mit.edu\\n\\n\\nTcpview is the result of several problems we had at UW.  We have several\\nNetwork General Sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on\\nseveral hundred subnets. These are good tools, but they are 1) heavy, \\n2) hard to find when you need one, 3) limited in their software expandibility,\\n4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis, 5) cannot be remotely\\noperated, and 6) cannot resolve names with DNS, requiring much manual \\nmanipulation of the name table.  We also sometimes use tcpdump, but we found \\nit 1) too difficult for most people, 2) did not have enough information for\\nmany protocols, 3) could not be used interactively, 4) could not handle\\nTCP streams and 5) could not read Sniffer files.  However, tcpdump did do\\na reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols, and could be easily\\nmodified.  Tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems\\nby adding a Motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.\\n\\nTcpview has been tested on a DECstation 5000 and Sun 4 under Ultrix 4.2 and\\nSunOS 4.1 respectively.  It should work on the same systems as tcpdump.\\nIt compiles with cc and gcc on the DEC and Sun.  To build tcpview you will\\nneed Motif 1.1 or better.\\n\\nThe following files are available for anonymous ftp from \\nftp.cac.washington.edu in /pub/networking\\n\\ntcpview-1.0.tar.Z\\ttcpview and tcpdump source code\\ntcpview-1.0.sun.tar.Z\\tSun4 binaries\\ntcpview-1.0.dec.tar.Z\\tDEC Mips Ultrix 4.2 binaries\\n\\nWhat tcpview adds to tcpdump:\\n- easier interface\\n- enhanced protocol decoding\\n- hex display of frame\\n- capture based on time, number of frames, or user interrupt\\n- can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer's name\\n- ethernet address host table\\n- can easily follow a stream, highlighting out-of-order frames\\n- can send TCP data to an external file or filter for additional\\n\\tprocessing.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nCHANGES TO TCPDUMP 2.2.1\\n\\nNew features:\\n\\nNow reads and writes Network General Sniffer files.  When used with '-r', the \\nfile type will be automatically detected.\\n\\nCan now read in (and use) an SNMP MIB file.\\n\\nThe hex format has been changed.\\n\\nNew time options have been added.\\n\\nOptions were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in TCP packets.\\n\\nBugs were fixed in the relative TCP sequence numbers. (-S flag)\\n\\nNew flags:\\n-R\\tread Sniffer file.  Not usually needed, except for reading from stdin\\n-ttt\\tprints delta times\\n-tttt\\tprints times relative to the first frame\\n-W\\twrite a Sniffer save file (use with -w)\\n-x\\tprint frame (minus link-level header) in hexdump format.  \\n\\tSample output:\\n\\n16:36:23.349851 jeff.cac.washington.edu.1285 > nic.funet.fi.ftp: S 0:0(0) win 16384\\n        0000  45 00 00 28 8a 98 00 00 3c 06 7c 9c 80 5f 70 02   |  E..(....<.|.._p.\\n        0010  80 d6 06 64 05 05 00 15 5b 19 4a 00 00 00 00 00   |  ...d....[.J.....\\n        0020  50 02 40 00 4e 13 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00         |  P.@.N.........\\n\\n-X\\tprint TCP data in hexdump format (used with -Z)\\n-z\\twrite TCP data to stdout (use with -t to eliminate timestamp)\\n-Z\\twrite frames and TCP data to stdout\\n\\n\\nMartin M.

Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals.\\nBrian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good\\ngoaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the\\nstretch to preserve the Blues lead.\\n\\nThe Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and\\ntaking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty\\non Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the\\nblue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired\\na long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After\\nthe goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks\\n10-9 in the first period.\\n\\nJeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on\\nthe left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour\\ncame out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown\\ncollected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.\\n\\nTwo minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a\\nshort-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy\\nRoenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass\\nacross the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.\\n\\nNoonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1.\\nStephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat\\nStephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan\\ndeflected the puck in the net.\\n\\nDenny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the\\nrebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for\\nthe shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards\\nto Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues\\noutshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.\\n\\nWith the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked\\nup a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith\\nwas called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.\\n\\nThe Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into\\nthe two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot,\\nand Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and\\npassed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp\\nangle.\\n\\nJust 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson\\nEmerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with\\ntwo Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the\\nslot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.\\n\\nThe Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph\\nmade some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy\\nMurray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game.\\nThe Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the\\npuck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held\\non to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period,\\ntotaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent\\nin the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on\\non four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in\\nthe league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.\\n \\nThe game was carried live on ABC, the first time an NHL game other than an\\nAll-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24, 1980, when\\nCBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.\\n\\nThe best-of-seven series continues Wednesday in Chicago and Friday and Sunday\\nin St. Louis.\\n\\nBox score\\n---------\\nBlues 4, Blackhawks 3\\n\\nBLUES       0    2    2   --   4\\nCHICAGO     1    2    0   --   3\\n\\nFIRST PERIOD\\n\\n   CHI -- Noonan 1 (Larmer, K.Brown), 8:17.\\n\\n   Penalties -- Shanahan, StL (holding), 2:28; Zombo, StL (interference), 6:00;\\nMurphy, Chi (high-sticking), 11:30; Grimson, Chi (boarding), 14:39; Zombo, StL\\n(holding), 18:46.\\n\\nSECOND PERIOD\\n\\n   STL -- Brown 1 (Shanahan, Emerson), 3:12.\\n   CHI -- (PPG) Noonan 2 (Roenick, Chelios), 5:40.\\n   CHI -- Noonan 3 (Matteau, Sutter), 8:51.\\n   STL -- Felsner 1 (McRae, Janney), 12:49.\\n\\n   Penalties -- Baron, StL (interference), 4:33; Wilson, StL (tripping), 9:31.\\n\\nTHIRD PERIOD\\n\\n   STL -- (PPG) Shanahan 1 (J.Brown, Hull), 11:12.\\n   STL -- (PPG) Hull 1 (Emerson, J.Brown), 11:29.\\n\\n   Penalties -- Shanahan, StL (roughing), 1:54; Matteau, Chi (high-sticking),\\n9:56; Smith, Chi (slashing), 10:49; Baron, StL (roughing), 14:23.\\n\\nSHOTS ON GOAL\\n\\nBLUES       10    10     7   --   27\\nCHICAGO      9     5    13   --   27\\n\\nPower-play Opportunities -- St. Louis 2 of 4; Chicago 1 of 7.\\n\\nGoaltenders -- St. Louis, Joseph, 1-0-0 (27 shots-24 saves).\\n               Chicago, Belfour, 0-1-0 (27-23).\\n\\nReferee -- Kerry Fraser.

But I can\\'t guarantee that I\\'m not way off base...\\n\\nThe permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talking\\ndirectly to the hard disk controller card.  The controller card must\\nuse the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that).\\nWindows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that\\npoints to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your\\ndisk to index to information in that file.\\n\\ncompressed disks are actually \"logical\" disks.  These disks have different\\ncharacteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore, the information\\non the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it must\\ngo through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating\\nsystem level or the BIOS level).  Because of this \"inbetween\" program, windows\\ncannot use direct methods to read from the \"logical\" disk.\\n\\na permenant swap file is only there to \"reserve\" an area of the disk that\\nwindows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically\\nnot even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space. (I don\\'t\\nknow if it does or doesn\\'t...but it checks for it somewhere everytime you\\nboot windows.)\\n\\na temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows\\nvia DOS and the BIOS.  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded\\nthe file access must go through DOS...TSR\\'S (disk compression)...and BIOS in\\norder to be access. (i.e. NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE...NEVER)\\n\\nmore on permenent swap files...\\n\\ni\\'m sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk\\nhas seen the message \"you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested\\nsize...windows will only use the size suggested...do you wan\\'t to create this\\nswap file anyway\" or something like that.\\n\\nwell, a friend of mine (ROBERT) called microsoft and asked them what and why.\\nwhat they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and\\ndivides that number by 2.  Then it checks for the largest contiguous block\\nof free disk space.  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers.\\n\\nThey also said that under absolutely no circumstances...NONE!...will windows\\nuses a swap file larger than the suggested size.  Well...that\\'s what he \\nsaid!\\n\\nI call bull@#$#.  If this is true why does windows report the memory is\\navailable to me if it\\'s not going to use it?\\n\\nany takers?\\n\\nJames\\n\\n(if this doesn\\'t get to the net, will someone post it for me?  thanks)\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'content': \"From: robert@cpuserver.acsc.com (Robert Grant)\\nSubject: Virtual Reality for X on the CHEAP!\\nOrganization: USCACSC, Los Angeles\\nLines: 187\\nDistribution: world\\nReply-To: robert@cpuserver.acsc.com (Robert Grant)\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: cpuserver.acsc.com\\n\\nHi everyone,\\n\\nI thought that some people may be interested in my VR\\nsoftware on these groups:\\n\\n*******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******\\n\\nMultiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality\\nsystem, primarily focused on entertainment/research.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\n   Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.\\n   No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).\\n   Generic clients.\\n   Customizable servers.\\n   Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).\\n   Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).\\n   Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily\\n        attached.\\n\\nFunctionality:\\n\\n  Client:\\n   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future\\n                           versions)\\n        dogfight - 72 lines\\n\\nLocation:\\n\\n   This software is located at the following site:\\n   ftp.u.washington.edu\\n\\n   Directory:\\n   pub/virtual-worlds\\n\\n   File:\\n   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z\\n\\nFutures:\\n\\n   Client:\\n\\n    o Texture mapping.\\n\\n    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading\\n\\n    o HMD support.\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Server:\\n\\n    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).\\n\\n    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Both:\\n\\n    o Improved Comms!!!\\n\\nI hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse\\nsoftware,\\nunfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure\\nwhether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(\\n\\nI hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of\\nthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I\\nwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!\\n\\nFinally one major disclaimer:\\n\\nThis is totally amateur code. By that I mean there is no support for this code\\nother than what I, out the kindness of my heart, or you, out of pure\\ndesperation, provide. I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad\\nthat may happen through the use of this code - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!\\n\\nDisclaimer over!\\n\\nOf course if you love it, I would like to here from you. And anyone with\\nPOSITIVE contributions/criticisms is also encouraged to contact me. Anyone who\\nhates it: > /dev/null!\\n\\n************************************************************************\\n*********\\nAnd if anyone wants to let me do this for a living: you know where to\\nwrite :-)!\\n************************************************************************\\n*********\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nRobert.\\n\\nrobert@acsc.com\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\"},\n",

He is the seal of all prophets\\ntill the day of judgement as stated in the Qur\\'an by Allah\\nSWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between\\n571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,\\nis a treason against Islam, against Qur\\'an, against the message\\nof Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another\\nmessenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.\\nHe is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his\\ncoming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur\\'an is from \\nChapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:\\n\\n\\tMuhammad is not the father of any of your men,\\n\\tbut (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal\\n\\tof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of\\n\\tall things.\\n\\n---------------------\\nCommentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,\\nit is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The \\nHoly Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.\\nAllah\\'s teaching is and will always be continuous, but there\\nhas been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later\\nages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not\\nan arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom,\\n\"for Allah has full knowledge of all things.\"\\n\\n----------------------\\nDROPLET VOL 1, No 11, Part 2\\n\\nA   D R O P L E T\\nFrom The Vast Ocean Of The Miraculous Qur\\'an\\n\\nTranslations from the Arabic and Turkish Writings of \\nBediuzzaman Said Nursi, The Risale-i Noor\\n\\nVOL 1, No 11, Part 2\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   \\t\\t NINETEENTH LETTER  \\n\\n\\t\\t MU\\'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI \\n(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)       \\n\\n(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)\\n\\n   SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW)\\ndeclared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a\\ndecree as the Glorious Qur\\'an and manifest miracles\\nwhich number, according to the scholars, one thousand.\\nThe occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as\\ncertain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In\\nfact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate\\nunbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise\\nOur\\'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His\\nmiracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) \\nsorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their\\nfollowers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the\\ncertainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars\\nof Islam) to the hundreth degree.\\n   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of\\nthe universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the\\neffect of the words,\\'You have indeed spoken the truth !\\'\\n   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,\\nwhile being observed by Him, \\'The true ruler has\\nappointed me to such and such position.  \\'At a time when\\nyou were asked to prove your claim, the word \\'Yes\\'\\nuttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if\\nthe ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your\\nrequest, this would confirm your claim even more soundly\\nand more definitely than would the word \\'Yes.\\'\\n   In the same way, ALLAH\\'s Most Noble Messenger\\nclaimed: \\'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this\\nuniverse.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken\\norder at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my\\nfingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five\\nspigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He\\nsplits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear\\nwitness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at\\nthis food: although it is barely enough for two or three\\nmen, it satisfies two or three hundred.  \\'Further he shows\\nhundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of\\nthe veracity of this high being and the proofs of his\\nprophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his\\ndeeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral\\nconduct and manners, his character and appearance\\nprove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.\\nIndeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the\\nfamous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief\\nmerely by seeing him, and said, \\'No lie can hide in this\\nface, nor can any fraud be found in it!\\'\\n   Although many of the  researchers have concluded\\nthat the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his\\nmiracles number about one thousand, there are\\nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of\\nhis prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of\\ntruth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions\\nhave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of\\nways.\\n   The Wise Our\\'an alone demonstrates thousands of\\nthe proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty\\naspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a\\nphenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of\\nindividuals who claimed prophethood and performed\\nmiracles have lived and passed away; then, the\\nprophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity\\nsuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For\\nwhatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the\\nmeans of the prophethood and messengership of all the\\nmessengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they\\nare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive\\nfashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and\\nmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the\\nperson of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found\\nin him with more certanity than all the other prophets.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\nTo be Continued Allah Willing.\\nIrfan Alan, A Servant of Islam.\\n\\n'},\n",

(if you are familiar with Insight, you know the kit\\nI mean).  I believe the drive is either a Texel (265ms) or an NEC\\n(280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the\\nbundle (at least two of their sales people couldn\\'t give me a straight\\nanswer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of OEM!).\\n\\nOther questions:\\n\\n- Excuse my ignorance, but is \"Texel\" a reputable maker in the CD-ROM\\n  market?  Or do you think NEC is the better drive?\\n\\n- Bottom line:  Is this kit worth the money?  (Currently, $449 for the\\n  TA-1000, and $699 for the TA-2000)\\n\\nAlternatively, I was thinking that the TA-2000 might be overkill for my\\nuses (however, I *do* want full multimedia capabilities, Photo CD stuff,\\neducational programs for my kids, etc.), and considered the lower-end\\nTA-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something\\nelse useful, like a tape back-up drive unit.\\n\\nBasically, I would just like to hear from those who have actually USED\\nthese kits, and whatever pros/cons you might advise, preferably\\ndirectly to the email address below.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nKoji\\n\\n                            2\\n                         _/\\n  ~~~~~~~~~~_/~~~~~~~~~~_/ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n  |        _/        _/    |                  Koji Kodama                  |\\n  |  by   _/      _/       |              Nippon Motorola Ltd.             |\\n  |      _/    _/          |            ryvg90@email.sps.mot.com           |\\n  |     _/  _/             |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|\\n  |    _/_/  _/            |      NOTE: The opinions expressed herein      |\\n  |   _/      _/           |   are mine, and do not reflect the opinions   |\\n  |  _/        _/          |or policies of Motorola Inc. or its affiliates.|\\n  ~~_/~~~~~~~~~~_/~~~~~_/~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n                 _/_/_/\\n'},\n",

I, for one,\\n: would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.\\n\\n\\nHear hear! I completely agree that we need to work quickly to\\nestablish alternatives to the government\\'s Clinton Clipper. As Brad\\nTempleton and others have noted, once the Clipper becomes ensconced in\\nenough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal*\\nstandard, and it will become the \"market* standard as well. (There is\\na lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is\\nmandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.)\\n\\n(There are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will\\nbe to make \"workalikes\" which meet the standard but which generate\\nphony or untappable keys...I\\'m sure the next several weeks will see\\nthese issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)\\n\\nMeanwhile, I\\'d be interested to hear RSA Data Security\\'s reaction.\\nOften criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual\\ncomplaints about MailSafe costing too much, at $125 or so, and the\\ngeneral issue of software patents...), we may find that *allying*\\nourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. What\\'s a mere\\nlicensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone who\\nwanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all of\\nRSA\\'s patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then RSA\\nwould make tons of money and be happy, I\\'m sure. A small price to pay.\\nFor those to whom $100 sounds like too much, I\\'m sure the actual terms\\ncould be different, spread out over several years, whatever. To me,\\nit\\'s a small price to pay.)\\n\\nStrong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys, sending copies of\\nkeys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces,\\nall done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is\\n*NOT* strong crypto!\\n\\nWhatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of\\npatenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in\\ncomparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal (note\\nthat I said \"potential\"...we\\'ll presumably learn more in the coming\\nmonths).\\n\\nThe RSA algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and\\nattacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no\\ndeliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).\\n\\nI know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems\\nusing off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) and\\nCELP-type software. The new generations of PCs, using fast 486s and\\nPentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combined\\nwith Diffie-Hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternative\\nto the Clipper system.\\n\\nOf course, we don\\'t really know if the Administration proposes to\\noutlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that their goal of tapping\\nterrorists, child pornographers, and Hilary bashers would be thwarted\\nif low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child\\npornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a\\nfew criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox\\nmode.)\\n\\nI suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had\\nwith RSA (and don\\'t look at me....I have both MacPGP *and* a fully\\nlegal copy of \"MailSafe\"!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.\\n\\nRSA?, Jim?, are you listening?\\n\\n-Tim May\\n\\nP.S. I reserve the right to retract these opinions if it should turn\\nout that RSA Data Security was involved in the Clipper proposal.\\n-- \\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

All too many patients read the insert and panic and then\\non the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug\\nand we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably\\ndidn\\'t even come back for followup because they didn\\'t want to admit\\nthey wouldn\\'t take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or\\nsomething.  What people don\\'t understand about the inserts is that they\\nreport every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating\\nthat the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough\\nliability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to\\nhappen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information\\non a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the\\nAMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific.\\nThere are very few drugs that someone hasn\\'t reported a death from taking.\\nPatients don\\'t realize that and don\\'t usually appreciate the risks\\nto themselves properly.  I\\'m sure Herman is going to \"go ballistic\",\\nbut so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been\\nreported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume\\nit could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will\\nrefuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for\\nPDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with\\ntools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need.\\nI am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the\\ndomain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions\\nabout migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient.\\nFor common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help\\nquite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the\\ncomputer and this would then not burden the physician.

If any of the rollers have a tiny layer of\\ncaked-on dirt, dust, or otherwise unidentifiable scum on them, carefully\\nscrape it off with a small knife (Xacto works great).  *Be Careful*\\nYou do not want to gauge the rollers, just clean off the dirt.\\nPut the ball back in, put the cover on, and there you are.  \\n\\nI clean a couple of dozen of these every month here.  Another symptom\\nis that when you move the mouse, it seems to \"click\" along.  If this\\ndoesn\\'t solve your problem, at least you have a clean mouse.  I highly\\nrecommend using a proper _soft_ mouse pad, and if you are a clean freak,\\nplace it in your drawer every night or when you don\\'t use it to keep\\nthe dust off.\\n\\nPersonally I prefer track balls.  Oh, which brings me to another point:\\nif your mouse or trackball tracks optically, and the sunlight is \\nstreaming through the window onto your mouse/trackball, you may notice\\nthat it will stop working.  If this happens to you, close the curtains\\nor blinds, or simply shade your pointing device, and see if that helps.\\n\\n-- \\n Peter Goudswaard                  _________                     _________\\n goudswaa@sfu.ca (preferred)      |         |      __/^\\\\__      |         |\\n pgoudswa@cln.etc.bc.ca           |         |      \\\\     /      |         |\\n pgoudswa@cue.bc.ca               |         |   _/\\\\_\\\\   /_/\\\\_   |         |\\n                                  |         |   >           <   |         |\\n \"There\\'s no gift like the present\"         |    >_________<    |         |\\n    - Goudswaard\\'s observation    |_________|         |         |_________|\\n'},\n",

If he/she\\ndoes not seem to take any action, keep going up higher and higher.\\nSexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated, and it can be an\\nenormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that\\nthey are trying to do something about it.  If you feel you can not\\ndiscuss this with your boss, perhaps your company has a personnel\\ndepartment that can work for you while preserving your privacy.  Most\\ncompanies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety\\ndoes seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs.\\n\\nIt is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not.  It is\\nnot inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee\\nproblems/strife even after eight years (it's a miracle if they do\\nnotice).  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of\\nhigher ups?  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the\\nentire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with\\nyou.

It appears that in\\na neutral park Bo\\'s HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two\\nhome runs).  Or do they?  What is \"equivalent average?\"\\n\\nOne thing, when looking at Bo\\'s stats, is that you can see that KC took\\naway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, \\nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \\n\\n> That is good.

Not even close.\\n\\n> He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his\\n> baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting.\\n> That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated.

I thought he\\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \\nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn\\'t\\nwinning.\\n\\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\\nmistake being made (by the SDCN\\'s, as they are known, on this group)\\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\\n\\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\\n\\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\\na player with poor MLE\\'s (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don\\'t (Oddibe\\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn\\'t hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\\nand so on.\\n\\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\\n\\nWhat hasn\\'t been established is what happens when you encounter a player\\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\\n\\nIt hasn\\'t been established that you can use MLE\\'s with two-sport players.\\n(It hasn\\'t been established that you can\\'t, but then statistics is, after\\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don\\'t mean what they usually mean?\\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \\n\\nThen again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank\\nthis year, live up to those poor MLE\\'s.  But you guys DON\\'T KNOW.  What\\'s \\nworse, you don\\'t know that you don\\'t.  And you don\\'t know that there are \\nother players you won\\'t know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties \\nagain.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.

That seems to be\\nthere for \"connectedness\" in the Body of Christ.  My brothers\\nand sisters ought to be involved so that there can be some\\naccountability on both our parts.  That\\'s part of the concept\\nfrom Hebrews about \"not forsaking the assembling of yourselves\\ntogether as is the custom of some.\"  We need each other because\\nLone Ranger Christians and Lone Ranger Marriages smack of a\\nself sufficiency that the I don\\'t see in the NT.  Does anyone\\nsee the Paul Simon \"I am a rock, I am an island...\" model anywhere\\nin Christianity. (Song lyrics show your age :-) ) ?\\n\\nFurther, since marriage is a legal matter/institution in the USA\\nand many other places, and such laws do not specifically go\\ncrosswise to the clear teachings of Scripture, we ought to\\nobey them to avoid even the appearance of \"evil\" (I Thess 5:22)\\n\\nSo this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage,\\nbut keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the \\nconscience of others because back to the beginning...you are\\nmarried when you and your intended promise each other and God\\nto be in convenant. (IMO)\\n\\nWhat ch\\'all think ?\\n\\nBobby - akgua!rjb\\n\\n[In some states, the kind of commitment described in Richard Szanto\\'s\\nposting can create a common law marriage.  Indeed his posting itself\\nmight go a long way towards establishing that a marriage exists,\\nshould the issue ever end up in court.

Velarde, Stankiewicz, and even Silvestri\\n>\\t  are better defensively than Owen.\\n\\n        Remember - it\\'s still early. Look for his offense to tail off, and his\\ndefense to improve (hopefully). He has that rep because I heard that either\\nlast year, or over the last 5 years, or something like that - he has the third\\nhighest fielding percentage among major league shortstops - behind C.R. and\\nTony (I\\'m not gonna help this sorry Mets team at all) Fernandez. I do agree\\nthough that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far.\\n>\\n>\\t2)Tartabull. The book on Tartabull was, keep him healthy and\\n>\\t  he\\'ll produce. Well, he hasn\\'t done too much so far. Sure. he\\'s\\n>\\t  hit a few homers, but those were all solo shots, and he hasn\\'t\\n>\\t  gotten any of the \"big\" RBIs that your cleanup man is supposed\\n>\\t  to give you. Then again, he had a slow start last year (once he\\n>\\t  got off the DL, that is) and turned into a one-man wrecking crew\\n>\\t  late in the year, so we\\'ll see.\\n>\\n>\\t3)The Bullpen. UGH!!!!!What happened? We were supposed to have\\n>\\t  one of the most solid pens in the majors!

We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the\\nprice was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide\\nour lives into \"before\" and \\'\\'after.\" We talk like that: that was before the\\nwar. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole\\nepoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,\\nit will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even \\nsharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now\\n. . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those\\ninhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our\\nlosses and everything that happened.\\n\\nNineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it\\nto pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would\\nbe such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and \\nthose who didn\\'t.\\n\\nThat second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you \\ncould already smell danger in the air. But we didn\\'t think that the danger was\\nnear and possible, so we didn\\'t take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as\\nmy parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. \\nMy parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought\\nthat they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.\\n\\nIn our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the\\nafternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all\\nour family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin\\ncrawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel\\nlike it\\'s all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our \\napartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in \\nhis hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely \\nlocked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We\\'re known as a \\nhospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people \\nwho were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends\\nof many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.\\n\\nMy parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my \\nmother, \"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\" But Mother was detached, pale, as \\nthough she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never \\nexpected it of her, she\\'s afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A \\ngirlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, \\n\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you\\'re not to come out \\nof the bedroom. We\\'re going to tell them that we\\'re alone in the apartment.\"\\n\\nWe went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl \\ncrawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and\\nKarina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that \\nperhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside \\nme. I\\'m an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to\\nembrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina \\nwas thinking the same thing, but she\\'s quite reserved. We didn\\'t have time to \\nsay anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. \\nThere was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from\\nexcited voices. I couldn\\'t figure what was going on out there because the door\\nto the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time\\nKarina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,\\nbut when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us \\nimmediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at \\nleast so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their \\neyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst\\nin, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn\\'t see. They \\ncame into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other \\nroom. He didn\\'t utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma \\nsnatched the axe from behind and said, \"Tell them not to touch the children. \\nTell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\" She\\nsaid this to Father in Armenian.\\n\\nThere were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They \\nunderstood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don\\'t know Armenian, \\nthey don\\'t need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \"You and \\nyour children both . . . we\\'re going to do the same thing to you and your \\nchildren that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, \\nour mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\" and \\nso on and so forth, \"and we came to do the same thing to you.\" This whole time\\nsome of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They \\nwere mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren\\'t any older people \\namong them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, \\nall the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I\\'m \\na teacher.\\n\\nSo they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took \\nhim in there, no they didn\\'t take him in there, they dragged him in there,\\nbecause he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all \\nbut a crack. We couldn\\'t see what was happening to Father, what they were \\ndoing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off \\nMamma\\'s sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \"I\\'m old enough to \\nbe your mother! What are you doing?!\" He struck her. Now he\\'s being held, \\nMamma identified him. I hope he\\'s convicted. Then they went after Karina, \\nwho\\'s been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying \\nto lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their \\nconsciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they \\nmustn\\'t do it. She said, \"Come on, let\\'s straighten this out, without \\nemotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we \\never do to you?\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come \\ninto our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and \\ncoming--said, \"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We \\ncame here to kill them.\"\\n\\nThey pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she \\ndidn\\'t cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \"What\\ndid we do to you? What did we do to you?\" And even later, when she came to, \\nshe said, \"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\"\\n\\nThat group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only \\nbroke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they \\nwere beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain \\nnor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do \\nwas watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they\\ndid to her. That\\'s why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, \\nthey beat her savagely . . . It\\'s really amazing that she not only lived, but \\ndidn\\'t lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they \\ncould to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, \\nkicking her, using anything they could find.\\n\\nMamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn\\'t feel any pain, \\njust didn\\'t feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they \\ndid. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn\\'t enough room in the\\napartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the \\ncorners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \"Let\\'s take her \\noutside.\"\\n\\nThose beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they \\nweren\\'t afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time \\nI thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren\\'t \\nafraid of what would happen to them.\\n\\nWhen they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered \\nwith blood--that\\'s when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several \\ntimes from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though \\nI were recording it all on film. I think I\\'m a kind person by nature, but I\\'m \\nvengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don\\'t deserve it. I hold \\na grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time \\nI would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I\\'d remember them, \\nand I\\'ll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me \\n\"forget,\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.\\n\\nAt some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and \\ndespite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found\\nthe strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had\\nto do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering \\nto an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that\\nhe\\'s being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me\\nand took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over\\nme. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that\\nthey planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up\\nwith their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a \\nreally deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I \\nsuddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly \\nI felt myself flying. I couldn\\'t figure out if I was really flying or if I \\njust imagined it. When I came to I thought now I\\'m going to smash on the \\nground. And when it didn\\'t happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was \\nstill lying on the floor. And since I didn\\'t scream, didn\\'t beg them at all,\\nthey became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with\\ntheir feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-\\ncially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.\\n\\nI came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. \\nSome people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn\\'t \\nneed any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had \\neven forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn\\'t worth \\nliving.\\n\\nThere was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman \\npain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come \\nbecause I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, \\nand when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to\\nput an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The \\nperson who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, \\nbecause he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he \\nhas four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, \\none who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, \\neven during the investigation he almost called me \"daughter,\" he apologized, \\nalthough, of course, he knew that I\\'d never forgive him. Something like that \\nI can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my \\nwords, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person\\'s shoes,\\nbut then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never \\nforget it.\\n\\nI wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one \\ncould protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of \\nbeasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn\\'t be able to do anything.\\nI knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.\\n\\nAnd Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a\\ncouple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn\\'t, so he tried to \\nkill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an \\nend to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into \\nthe other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don\\'t know which one it \\nwas, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was \\nthrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her \\nand made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all \\nthe deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor \\nfrom the Melkumians\\' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a \\nlittle. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,\\nhow we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He\\'s a good person. He said, \\n\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,\\nI, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\" he\\nsays, \"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and \\nthink I never shall again.\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw \\neverything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken \\nthe father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He \\nsaw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven\\npeople. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the \\nbrothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that \\nthey were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to \\ndo something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I\\n\\nAfter I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and \\nLyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn\\'t even \\nremember my sister\\'s name. I wanted to cry \"Marina!\" out to her, but could\\nnot. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn\\'t\\nfor the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus\\nI saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had\\ntold them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both\\nthere by chance, that they weren\\'t Armenians. Lyuda\\'s a Russian, you can tell \\nright away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that\\nshe was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I\\'m glad \\nthat at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . \\nalthough her spirit was murdered . . .\\n\\nAt some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that \\nmob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his \\nname, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \"Igor,\\nhelp!\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were \\ntaking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and \\nLyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the \\nneighbors.\\n\\nAnd the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, \\nsomething like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.\\n \\nThen they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, \\nthey were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out \\nonto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already \\nsure that I was dead because I didn\\'t react at all to the new blows. Someone \\nsaid, \"She\\'s already dead, let\\'s throw her out.\" When they carried me out onto\\nthe balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I \\nheard someone say in Azerbaijani: \"Don\\'t kill her, I know her, she\\'s a \\nteacher.\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can\\'t remember\\nwhose voice it was. It wasn\\'t Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an \\naccent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks\\nAzerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and\\nthrew me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and \\tI having opened my \\neyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had \\nbeen beaten so much that I didn\\'t have the strength to remember him. I only \\nremember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately \\nI can\\'t remember anything more.\\n\\nWhat should I say about Igor? He didn\\'t treat me badly. I had heard a lot \\nabout him, that he wasn\\'t that good a person, that he sometimes drank too\\nmuch. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that \\nwomen usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,\\nif he was wounded, then it\\'s about eighty percent sure that he will be treated\\nvery sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in \\nUfa, and was injured, but that\\'s not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that \\nall out later.\\n\\nAmong the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary \\nof the Party organization. I don\\'t know his last name, his first name is \\nNajaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn\\'t so sure,\\nshe was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she \\ndidn\\'t want to endanger him. She said, \"He was there,\" and a little while \\nlater, \"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. \\nNo, it seems like it was he.\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see \\nus the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something \\nentirely different. The investigators haven\\'t summoned him yet. He came to see\\nus in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought \\ngroceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started \\ncrying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don\\'t know if he was putting \\nus on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned \\nhim to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn\\'t in Sumgait. \\nThe fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is \\nright, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don\\'t know how the \\ninvestigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was\\ntold that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn\\'t he have gone \\nto Baku and arranged an alibi? I\\'m not ruling out that possibility.\\n\\nIll now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she \\nbought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her \\nwedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband\\'s \\nlives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A \\nRussian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He\\'s an orphan who was raised by\\nhis grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a \\nspecial school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I\\'ll say this--I\\'m \\na teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that\\nboy is not at all mentally handicapped. He\\'s healthy, he can think just fine, \\nand analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he\\'s cunning, too. \\nAfter that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.\\n\\nHe beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \"Lady, if you give us all the gold \\nand money in your apartment we\\'ll let you live.\" And Mamma told them where \\nthe gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and \\neveryone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other \\nover and taking the gold from one another. I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t kill one \\nanother right then.\\n\\nMamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was\\nblack and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she \\nran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his\\nmouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-\\nlow. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn\\'t walk; like me, he was half dead, \\nhalfway into the other world. He couldn\\'t comprehend anything, couldn\\'t see, \\nand was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, \\nit was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.\\n\\nThe bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father \\nout of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,\\na small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people \\nwere standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, \\neverywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee\\nservice--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \"I was afraid \\nto turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the \\nthreshold I couldn\\'t hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and \\ndragged him down the stairs to the neighbors\\'.\" Mamma remembered one of the \\ncriminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, \\nout of one eye. She says, \"I realized that my death would come from that \\nperson. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\"\\nLater they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.\\n\\nI was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina \\nwas already outside, I didn\\'t know what they were doing to her. I was left all\\nalone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even\\nthough I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and\\nLyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.\\nI went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. \\nBut when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones \\nI had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the \\nones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and \\nthat all of that would die with me.\\n\\nAt some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I \\ndidn\\'t know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that\\nwe were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \"Neighbor, is that\\nyou?\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived\\nI would remember him. That\\'s when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been \\ntaken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to \\ntake the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he\\nhad struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he \\nstarted getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. \\nThe newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor\\'s axe froze in \\nthe air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the \\npresence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities \\nor not. He said, \"Enough, let\\'s go to the third entryway.\" In the third \\nentryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once \\nagain that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as \\nthey went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they \\nfound, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had \\nalready taken the other.\\n\\nFour people remained in the room, soldiers who didn\\'t obey their general. They\\nhad to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over\\nthose 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I \\nidentified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an \\nAzerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:\\n\"Sister, don\\'t be afraid, I\\'ll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\"\\nThat\\'s just what he said, \"those Azerbaijanis,\" as though he himself were not \\nAzerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \"I\\'ll drive\\nthem out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails\\nand nail the door shut, because they\\'ll be coming back from Apartment 41.\" \\nThat\\'s when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the \\nperson in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened \\nto, the \"general,\" said that they were going to the third entryway.\\n\\nKuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn\\'t do it by myself. \\nMarina\\'s old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I\\nwas racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. \\nHe wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. \\nBut the door was lying on the floor in the hall.\\n\\nI went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt \\nfrom flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find \\nanything. He told me, \"Well, fine, I won\\'t leave you here. Would any of the \\nneighbors let you in? They\\'ll be back, they won\\'t calm down, they know you\\'re \\nalive.\" He told me all this in Armenian.\\n\\nThen he returned to the others and said, \"What are you waiting for? Leave!\" \\nThey said, \"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her \\nyourself. No, we want to do it to.\" He urged them on, but gently, not \\ncoarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just\\nboys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went\\ndown to the third floor with them himself, and said, \"Leave. What\\'s the mat-\\nter, aren\\'t you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\" And\\nhe came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that \\nhe couldn\\'t hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I \\ntold him at the neighbors\\' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really\\ngood terms with them.\\n\\nWe knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman \\nopened the door and immediately said, \"I\\'m an Azerbaijani.\" He said, \"I know. \\nLet her sit at your place a while. Don\\'t open the door to anyone, no one knows\\nabout this, I won\\'t tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\" She says, \"Fine,\\nhave her come in.\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I \\nhad gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into \\ntears. Even though I was wearing Marina\\'s old fur coat, it\\'s a short one, a \\nhalf-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \"Do you know where my family \\nis, what happened to them?\" She says, \"No, I don\\'t know anything. I\\'m afraid \\nto go out of the apartment, now they\\'re so wild that they don\\'t look to see \\nwho\\'s Azerbaijani and who\\'s Armenian.\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my \\nneighbor says, \"You know, Lyuda, I don\\'t want to lose my life because of you, \\nor my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\" During the butchery in our\\napartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl\\nearrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was \\nstill there. When I\\'m nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I \\ntouched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it\\nto her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.\\n\\nI went out and didn\\'t know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I \\ndon\\'t know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I \\nend up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the \\napartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. \\nI had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had \\nhidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near \\nsome broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. \\nThen they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I \\nthink that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were\\nbroken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay \\nthere without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town \\ncould hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that\\'s what saved me. They were \\nburning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started\\npicking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father\\'s sport \\njacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the\\none end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. \\nAnd again I realized I wasn\\'t getting out of there alive, and I started to \\nstrangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on \\nmy mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me\\nafterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got \\nburned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone\\'s hand was\\nprotecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn\\'t know \\nhow. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if \\nI found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I \\nhad never been so close to death and couldn\\'t imagine how you could go on \\nliving without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I \\nthought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda\\'s place or someone is hiding her. \\nI tried to think that Igor wouldn\\'t let them be killed. He served in \\nAfghanistan, he should protect her.\\n\\nWhile I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I\\nthought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would \\nshe live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among \\nthemselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no\\nchildren\\'s footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. \\nAnother said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good \\njob fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was \\nall over. They started to argue. A third one says, \"How come you get it? I \\nhave four children, and there are three rooms here, that\\'s just what I need. \\nAll these years I\\'ve been living in God-awful places.\" Another one says, \\n\"Neither of you gets it. We\\'ll set fire to it and leave.\" Then someone said \\nthat Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their\\nplace. And they, to my good fortune, didn\\'t set fire to the apartment, and\\nleft.\\n\\nOh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite \\nfrequently, \"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let \\nthem bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\" Then they \\nsaid, \"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\" They repeated it \\nvery often.\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference for #008 - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Center for Regional Studies\\nLines: 95\\n\\nIn article <1993Apr21.032746.10820@doug.cae.wisc.edu> yamen@cae.wisc.edu\\n(Soner Yamen) responded to article <1r20kr$m9q@nic.umass.edu> BURAK@UCSVAX.\\nUCS.UMASS.EDU (AFS) who wrote:\\n\\n[AFS]     Just a quick comment::\\n[AFS]\\n[AFS]     Armenians killed Turks------Turks killed Armenians.\\n[AFS]\\n[AFS]     Simple as that. Can anybody deny these facts?\\n\\nJews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was \\nquite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi \\nrevisionists say!\\n\\n[SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in\\n[SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups)\\n[SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother.\\n[SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were \\n[SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy \\n[SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not \\n[SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my\\n[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these \\n[SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe \\n[SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,\\n[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...\\n\\nThere is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the\\nArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-\\nGeorgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever \\nkilled in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of\\nAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-\\nGeorgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after\\nthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the\\nextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died\\nin this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of\\npreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish \\ngenocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers\\naway!\\n\\n[SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people\\n[SY] around, people assumed that \\'Armenians killed us, raped our women\\',\\n[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed\\n[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these \\n[SY] people not to hate all Armenians. \\n\\nI don\\'t follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.\\n\\n[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,\\n[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.\\n[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some\\n[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.\\n[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish\\n[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with\\n[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately\\n[SY] very easy to start a fire!\\n\\nAgain, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to\\ndo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that\\nthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, \\nand Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through \\nTiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians \\nmilitarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of\\nCaucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement \\ncaused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years \\nearlier in eastern Anatolia. My father\\'s mother\\'s family escaped Cemiskezek -> \\nErzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople -> \\nMassachusetts. \\n\\n[SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience\\n[SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were\\n[SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to\\n[SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves\\n[SY] unattractive! I don\\'t want to go into any graphic detail.\\n\\nMy grandmother\\'s brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste\\npotato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian\\nyoung man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential,\\nlocal Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive \\ntoday.\\n\\n[SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense.\\n[SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.  But\\n[SY] as I said they were living in peace with their neighbors before. Why \\n[SY] should they become enemies?\\n\\n\\n-- \\nDavid Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"How do we explain Turkish troops on\\nS.D.P.A.

It shouldn\\'t reach back beyond the ROM/RAM/VRAM\\nSIMMs, though.\\n\\n>\\tOne last question!

Should I just\\n>cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place?\\n\\nYou can special-order parts to mount the device from your local Apple\\ndealer.  The relevant parts are:\\n\\n  922-0358  blank bezel faceplate\\n  922-0850  CD-ROM carrier [i.e., generic 5.25\" device mounting bracket]\\n\\nNote Apple\\'s unfortunate choice of name for the slide-in bracket to\\nmount a 5.25\" device.  The service techs I talked to said, \"Oh sure,\\nwe stock those.\"  Of course they were thinking of the CD caddies to\\nhold a CD disk when you stick it in the drive.\\n\\nAs far as I can tell, Apple does not sell a bezel faceplate already\\ncut out for a standard 5.25\" device.  (Why not?  They advertise\\nthese machines as being able to accept any standard device in the\\n5.25\" bay, why not provide the faceplate?)   They do sell a cutout for\\ntheir CD-ROM drive (of course), but that\\'s of no use.\\n\\nI\\'m going to hack up the extra bezel I ordered to make a cutout for my\\ntape drive, which is a standard 5.25\" device.\\n\\nGood luck with your SyQuest.\\n\\n\\t-Fred\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

I moved there from\\nNovosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred\\nto Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is\\nArutunian, my husband\\'s name . . .\\n\\nThat there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints \\nand gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the \\nRussians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past \\nyear. I couldn\\'t find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because \\nI, I\\'ll just say it, couldn\\'t steal, couldn\\'t deceive, and couldn\\'t be \\ninvolved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they \\ntold me, \"Leave, don\\'t keep the others from working, you aren\\'t cut out for \\nthis kind of work.\" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at \\nthe Armenians, like \"The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way\\nthey\\'ve multiplied here they\\'re making it hard for us to live,\" and \"Things \\nwill be just fine if we get rid of them all.\" \"No problem, the Turks will \\nhelp,\" they say, \"if we ask them, they\\'ll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an \\nhour.\" Well that\\'s the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it \\nwould spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn\\'t imagine it. \\nHere we\\'ve been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one \\neven considered such an idea possible.\\n\\nBut I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative \\npeople I would often ask, \"Where is this all leading, do people really not see\\nwhat kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, \\nthere are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what\\'s going\\non?\" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that \\neverything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of \\nit if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the\\ndemonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn\\'t be saying this now if I \\nhadn\\'t received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were \\nunder guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. \\nThe women told me, \"There he is, there he is, that\\'s Muslimzade.\" I didn\\'t \\nbelieve the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that \\nthey were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, \"Are you the First \\nSecretary of our City Party Committee?\" He answers me, \"Yes.\" And I ask him, \\n\"Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani \\nflag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don\\'t know \\nexactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?\" And he tells\\nme, \"Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.\" Then I asked him\\nanother question: \"And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering \\nus? And he said, \"I. . . We didn\\'t know what to do, we didn\\'t know, we didn\\'t \\nanticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.\"\\n\\nComrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the \\nAzerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: \"No, we actually didn\\'t \\nanticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain \\nthe crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre.\" Those are his \\nexact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the\\nArmenian SSR.\\n\\nAnd now, about the events themselves. Of course it\\'s painful to discuss them, \\nbecause it may seem that it\\'s not true to someone else. Various rumors \\nconcerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren\\'t. \\nBut unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so \\nhorrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of\\nprogress, I don\\'t know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in\\nor around Moscow, I wouldn\\'t have believed it. Why not? Because it was really \\na genocide, it was a massacre. That\\'s genuinely what it was.\\n\\nFor example, on that day, the 28th--I didn\\'t know about the 27th because my \\nhusband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on \\nthe 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, \"You\\'re in bed? You don\\'t \\nknow anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they \\nwere overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars \\nand asking, \\'Are you an Armenian?\\' If they answered in Armenian, then they \\nturned the car over and burned it.\" This isn\\'t made up, the wife of the Senior\\nInvestigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was \\nreturning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she\\'s my \\nneighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the \\nmiddle of it, I don\\'t know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they \\nwere stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him\\nhonk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn\\'t even believe it, and \\nI said, \"Certainly that didn\\'t happen, how can that be?\" And she said, \\n\"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely\\nsmashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw \\nthat they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \"Don\\'t break \\nthe shop windows, don\\'t destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.\\n\" I didn\\'t hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was\\ntorn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians \\nalthough he\\'s an Azerbaijani.\\n\\nWhile we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova\\nis the first to look out the window and say, \"Look, there\\'s a crowd out \\nthere.\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had \\nalready started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian \\nfamily there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I\\'m sorry, I \\ndon\\'t know the building number or the people\\'s names, since we were in my \\nhusband\\'s apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. \\nThere was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things \\nwere going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once \\nwasn\\'t enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn\\'t finished\\nthe Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \\nbeat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing \\nthe hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on \\ntelevision, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn\\'t tell \\nus why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn\\'t \\nhave touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn\\'t dared to stick up for the \\nArmenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.\\n\\nAt the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, \\nand so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly \\noff a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down \\nthere, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At \\nfirst I couldn\\'t figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, \\n\"Lendrush, l think they\\'re beating someone out there.\" And he answered, \"I \\ndon\\'t know, could be.\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw \\nit, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, \\nhe didn\\'t see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging \\nher. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell \\ndown, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \\nbalconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \\nblocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that\\'s a good block and a half or two \\nfrom here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\\n\\nThen the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\\nof course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\\nI also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\\nthat woman, because I had just seen that.\\n\\nI asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \"You kill me first, and then \\nlet them do what they want with the corpse.\" But our neighbors, it\\'s true, \\ndefended us, they said, \"There aren\\'t any Armenians in our entryway, go away, \\nonly Muslims live here.\" Disaster missed us that time.\\n\\nBut at two o\\'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, \\ncame back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he\\'s \\nupset about something, but I can\\'t. I was standing, running from balcony to \\nbalcony. Our power was out, I don\\'t remember for how long, but it was as \\nthough it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, \\nand I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look \\nand the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first \\ntime they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the \\nmorning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the \\nAzerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them \\ntoo. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking\\ngarbage out at two o\\'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went \\ntoward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \\ncould see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \\nAzerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \"What do you want?\" And \\nthey answered, \"We want the Armenian family that lives here\" [pointing toward \\nthe second floor with their hands]. She says, \"I already told you, we don\\'t \\nhave any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman \\ntalking to you,\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around\\nher and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they \\nseemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing \\nand left. That was the second time death was at our door.\\n\\nI forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, \\nI don\\'t know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we \\nreally didn\\'t know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth \\nfloor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight \\nmonths, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to \\nearn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture \\nand was getting ready to give his daughter\\'s hand in marriage, but, alas,\\neverything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything \\nout the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on \\nthe left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that \\nhadn\\'t already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means \\nthat the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to \\nbe of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been \\nforeseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of \\napartments. Something on the order of \"We\\'ll move the Armenians out and take \\nover their apartments.\"\\n\\nI have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I \\ncame as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the \\nConsulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I \\nknew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in \\nSumgait that there wasn\\'t anything holy about them, that Party membership was \\nbought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were \\nno ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw \\nall of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.\\n\\nI can\\'t talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I\\nwent out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they \\nhad arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some \\nRussian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and\\njoined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with \\nthe situation the way it was. And what\\'s interesting is that when we left on \\nthe buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure \\npeople would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for \\nthe Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But \\nhaving analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having \\nthought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. \\nIf a lot of Azerbaijanis didn\\'t want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, \\nand that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to \\ncalm them down--then is it possible that he didn\\'t have people at hand to whom\\nhe could whisper at the last minute, \"Go and announce it on television: \\nCitizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let\\'s protect our \\nneighbors from this massacre?\" Those crowds weren\\'t such that there was no \\ncontrolling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn\\'t have firearms, \\nmostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature \\nshafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we \\nnoticed them: there aren\\'t rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were \\nbrought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was \\nsaying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend \\nus, why wasn\\'t it arranged? It means that the government didn\\'t want to do \\nit. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, \\nwhat, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!\\nThe crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won\\'t mention the things \\nI didn\\'t see myself, I\\'ll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They \\nwere in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o\\'clock in the evening, when I saw them\\nfrom the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one \\no\\'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They\\nhadn\\'t completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. \\nWhen they returned to our building I told my husband, \"Lendrush, now the \\npolice are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably \\ngoing to find out and come to our aid.\" Well, alas, no, there were to be no \\nauthorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single \\nambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,\\nbeginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,\\nand burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, \\nit was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in \\nBlock 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they \\nattacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed\\nsoldiers, and how on that square, I can\\'t remember the name of it, where there\\nis that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I\\'m upset and\\nI can\\'t think of the name . . . there\\'s a tall building there, a 9-story, and \\nfrom the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, \\nwearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against \\nthat mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using \\nstones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have \\nguessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under \\nthe Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under \\nSoviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get \\ninvolved.\\n\\nIf you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the\\ntruth, I\\'ve been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five \\nyears that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered \\nme a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I\\'m an adventure seeker, and\\nsome, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become\\noutraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a \\nSoviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,\\nor the property of some magnate, or some \"mafia\": If I want to, I\\'ll get you \\nout of here; If I want to, I\\'ll get rid of you; If I want to, I\\'ll do \\nsomething else? And there\\'s a black market price for everything, in the most \\nbrazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so\\nmuch. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor\\'s pool, he had \\nthe nerve to tell me, maybe you won\\'t even believe this, but this, I\\'m afraid,\\nI heard with my own ears: \"Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something\\nthat you know will never have any effect? You\\'re alone against everyone, so \\ninstead why don\\'t you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything \\nwill go fine for you.\" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I \\ndo, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.\\nAnd the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see\\nit. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed \\nit, I still have a copy, but what\\'s the use? When the General Procuracy got \\ninvolved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to \\nthe information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony \\nabout the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don\\'t know \\nif they\\'re going to pursue it or not. Because, you\\'ll excuse me, I no longer \\nbelieve in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It\\'s all \\ndead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most \\nimportant, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that\\'s nonsense, that\\nall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in \\nyou--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...\\n\\nI want to tell of one incident. I just don\\'t know, at the time I was in such a\\nstate that I didn\\'t even take minor things into account. Here is an example.\\nOf course, it\\'s not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a\\nson, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,\\nVitaly [Danielian], I don\\'t know his last name, goes to school with him, or\\nrather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to\\nmake a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there\\'s one important detail:\\nWhen the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren\\'t working in \\nArmenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.\\nBut the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call \\nanywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off\\nfor no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they\\nliked They weren\\'t afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap \\ntheir hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.\\n\\nNow I\\'m going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an\\nArmenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. \\nAccording to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the\\nsame apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put\\nthrough--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to\\nhis mother and said, \"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik\\'s, what if they kill\\nhim? Maybe he\\'s still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.\\n. . . He\\'s a nice guy, we all like him, he\\'s a good person, he\\'s smart.\" His \\nmother wouldn\\'t let him go. In tears, she says, \"Valery, you can\\'t go because \\nI am afraid.\" He says, \"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We\\'ll just watch, \\njust have a look.\" They made it through. I don\\'t know, I think Vitalik\\'s\\nparents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \\nsuperficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken \\neverywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian \\napartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that \\nthe windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows \\nin that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and \\nVitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \\nbeen murdered. Little Vitalik didn\\'t even know they were dead. So two weeks \\nago, I don\\'t know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \\nleft Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \\nYerevan. So it\\'s been about a month already; it\\'s so hard to keep all this \\nstraight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik\\'s family has\\nbeen killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and\\nhis classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn\\'t admit \\nthem, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in \\na coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \\nkicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought \\nthere in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .\\n\\nWhen we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, \\nthrow ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if \\nthese friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And\\nwhen you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When\\nyou saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.\\n\\nIf you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of \\nthings it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped \\nwere entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I\\'m not lying, \\nthat girlfriend came up to one of them and said, \"What happened?\" and she \\nbared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . \\nthose rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that \\nI don\\'t know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.\\n\\nNow . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,\\nwell, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,\\nsome six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group\\nof people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a\\npoint when I couldn\\'t even go outside because if you went outside you saw\\nso much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .\\n\\nYes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians\\naround Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground\\nwith bulldozers. I didn\\'t know whether to believe it or not. And people who \\ndon\\'t know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when \\nI arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are \\nnot only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they \\nwere guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a \\nsingle person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan \\nall the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn\\'t attack \\nanyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there\\ncould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don\\'t\\nknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \\nguilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\\nAzerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\\nonly perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \\nseems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \"Did \\nyou know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 \\npeople, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an \\nArmenian?\"\\n\\nOf course I\\'m upset, but it\\'s utterly impossible to discuss such things and\\nnot become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to\\nthe time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.\\nWhen I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I \\ncouldn\\'t believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already\\nmentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \"Why \\ndid you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at \\nthese women who are strewn about on the floor?\" The overcrowding there was \\ntremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\\nalready sick. It\\'s true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \\ncooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \\nthe thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \\nit everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \\nwere never given any direct orders, they didn\\'t know what they were authorized\\nto do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o\\'clock in the evening\\nthat Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \\nwas given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \\npersonnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart \\nadvised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\\n\\nBut that\\'s not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, \\ntried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\\nCommittee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\\nhand and said, \"Citizen, don\\'t worry, we\\'ll go and have a talk in my office.\\nI told him, \"No, after everything you\\'ve done, I don\\'t believe one iota of \\nwhat you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I\\'ll disappear, and the \\ntraces of me will disappear too. Because you can\\'t stand it when . . . \" Oh \\nyes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \\nvery funny, although at the time I wasn\\'t up to laughing. He was in a nice, \\nexpensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \"Oh, why \\ndid you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\\nyou\\'re in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\\nto ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\\nalready getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\\nthem?\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don\\'t know who \\nhe was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade\\'s head \\nand hid it. Then I said, \"My God! We\\'re not marauders. We\\'re not you! We \\ndidn\\'t come to you with the intention of stealing!\" \"Well kill me, kill me!\" \\nMuslimzade says to me, \"But I\\'m not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I\\'m not\\nguilty.\" And I say, \"OK, fine, you\\'re not guilty, have it your way. But give \\nus an answer, we\\'re asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \\nraping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \\ncarrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \\nthen?\" \"You know, we didn\\'t expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn\\'t \\nanticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\" I started \\nlaughing and said, \"It\\'s truly funny.\" He says, \"What could I do? We didn\\'t \\nknow what to do.\" And I say, \"I\\'m sorry, but it\\'ll be ridiculous if I tell \\nyou: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn\\'t march out in \\nfront with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \\nover his dead body. That\\'s what you should have done. That\\'s the way it was \\nduring the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\\neither he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \\naway, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \\nexcuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \\nyou tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \\nThat\\'s right,\" I told him, \"the City party committee got confused, all the \\nparty committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \\nthey all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \\nimpunity. And if it weren\\'t for the troops it wouldn\\'t have been just two \\ndays, there wouldn\\'t be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \\nhave finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some \\nRussians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told \\nthem, \\'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we\\'ll come after you, too.\"\\n\\nAnd by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was\\nthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later\\narrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\\nthe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \\nasked him, \"What? How? What will come of us?\" He openly said, \"You know, for \\nus the main thing now is to catch that gang. We\\'ll finish that quickly. You\\'ll\\nstay at the military unit for the time being, and we\\'ll decide later.\" The \\nGeneral Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \\ncities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \\nthe affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\\nas everyone knows, he\\'s the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \\nhe gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \\nby the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn\\'t not say it, \\nbecause he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \\nand he said, \"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it\\'s\\nhorrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \\npunished, in accordance with our laws.\" And that\\'s a quote. Then one mother \\nthrows herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\\n\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" They tried \\nto calm her down, and he said, \"In order for us to conduct a proper \\ninvestigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you \\nmust help us, because we don\\'t know, maybe there was someone else in the gang \\nwho is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe \\nsomeone saw something. Don\\'t be afraid, write about it in detail. So that \\nyou\\'re not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having \\nlived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth \\nabout, let\\'s say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge \\nlater. We\\'re going to do it like this: We\\'re going to set up an urn and you \\ncan throw what you write in there. We don\\'t need to know who wrote it. The \\nnames of the people who write won\\'t be made public, but we need all the\\ninformation. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is \\nnecessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening \\ngibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put \\nthe information into the urn.\"\\n\\nTwo soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, \\npeople who didn\\'t even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she \\ncame up and said, \"You, as a Russian, the same thing won\\'t happen to you as \\nwill happen to me. So please . . . I\\'ll give you the information, and you \\nplease write it down for me.\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like\\nher . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down\\neverything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don\\'t know if \\nit will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that \\ninformation. One person can lie, but thousands can\\'t lie, thousands simply \\ncan\\'t lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, \\nshould someone say that black is white if it is really black?\\n\\n   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani\\nSSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council \\nof Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the \\none who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their \\nprevious dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, \\nand it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very \\npolitely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and \\nwhen I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, \"Where were\\nyou personally when they were beating us? Now you\\'re trying to convince us to \\nreturn, why didn\\'t you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where \\nit was all leading?\" he says, \"You\\'re telling the truth. Let\\'s not mince \\nwords. You\\'ve told me right to my face, and I\\'ll tell you straight. I\\'ll tell \\nyou the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole \\ngovernment was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about \\n45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its \\nfine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.\"\\nI say, \"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting \\nit?\" And he says, \"You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it \\nin Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . \" I say, \"Fine, \\nyou didn\\'t know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have \\nknown. Why did no one help us?\" And he says, \"Well, OK, we didn\\'t know what to\\ndo\" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from \\nMuslimzade. Later, when he said, \"You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is \\nfavorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the \\nAzerbaijanis . . . \" To this l answered, \"You know what . . . I\\'m speaking \\nwith you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with \\nArmenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, \\nplease, Comrade Mamedov, \" I asked him, \"What would you say about this\\nhonestly, if you were being completely frank with us?\" Then he said, \"Yes, I \\nadmit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we \\nhave disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before \\nthe whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign \\nradio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.\"\\nAnd I say, \"There\\'s nothing to add to what really happened. I don\\'t think it\\'s\\npossible to add anything more awful.\" He says, \"Yes, I agree with you, I \\nunderstand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence.\" I repeat that he\\nsaid \"unfortunate occurrence.\" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what \\nhe was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--\\nand said, \"Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . \" I take this to mean that \\nhe really thinks it\\'s an \"unfortunate occurrence.\" \"And of course,\" he says, \\n\"I understand that having gone through all this you can\\'t return to Sumgait, \\nbut it\\'s necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being \\ntried.\" And he even gave a detail, which, I don\\'t know if it matters or not, \\nthat 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody \\naffair.\\n\\nYes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in\\nBaku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an \\nAzerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, \"What, they didn\\'t\\nnail your husband? They screwed up.\" I was floored, I hadn\\'t imagined that\\nanyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up\\nto see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was\\ngoing to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from \\nFebruary 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \"I don\\'t know, \\nTatyana, go to the head of the conductors\\' pool. Be grateful if they don\\'t \\nput it down as unexcused absence.\" I was really discouraged by this. They all \\nknow that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here \\nthey\\'re telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying \\nmyself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name\\nis Rasulov, and he\\'s had that position for many years. Incidentally, he\\'s a \\nParty member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and \\nsaid, \"Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \" He looked at me askance\\nand said, \"And why are you\"--he knows me by my previous last name--\"why did\\nyou get wrapped up in this mess?\" I say, \"What do you mean, why did I get \\nwrapped up in this mess? My husband\\'s an Armenian,\" I tell him, \"I have an \\nArmenian last name.\" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as \\nthough he had eaten something sour, and said, \"I didn\\'t expect that you would\\n. . . \" What did he mean by that? And \"how\" should he behave, the chief of the\\npool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it\\'s true, there was a \\nreduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And \\nif someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what \\ncan you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!\\nHe\\'s going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, \\nthe Armenians are like that, and so on . . .\\n\\nBy the way, that Mamedov--now I\\'m going back to Mamedov\\'s office when I asked \\nhim \"Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return \\nto Sumgait?\" he answered, \"Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don\\'t\\nwant to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I \\nwon\\'t guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\" I say, \"So you\\'ve got another\\nthing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they\\'ll be quiet and then \\nin another 50 years it\\'ll happen again?!\" I couldn\\'t contain myself any more,\\nand I also told him, \"And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew\\nabout it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in \\nSumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received\\ncomplaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did \\neveryone ignore what was going on? Didn\\'t you prepare people for this by the \\nway you treated them?\" And he says, \"You know, you\\'re finally starting to \\ninsult me!\" He threw his pen on the desk. \"Maybe now you\\'ll say I\\'m a \\nscoundrel too?\" I say, \"You know, I\\'m not talking about you because I don\\'t \\nknow. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that \\ncomrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.\\n\"Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, \\nthat 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had \\ngotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. \\n\"We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of \\nthe Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of \\nArmenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in\\nSumgait.\" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, \\'\\n\"Well, I walked down the street.\" And I said, \"Walking down the street in any \\ncity, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation\\nbecause I would be a guest, I don\\'t have any contact with people, but if you \\nspend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn\\'t \\nknow you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you\\'d \\nhear something quite different.\" I told him, for example, that I drew my \\nconclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took\\nus all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;\\nthey got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the \\nneighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I \\nthought maybe that in fact it wasn\\'t something general, of a mass nature, some\\nanti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it\\nwas the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier \\naccompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything \\nthere were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with\\nus, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young \\npeople, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they \\nwere making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police\\ndetachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and \\ntanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when \\nthe situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they \\nwithdraw protection from the city altogether? There will be more outrages, of \\ncourse, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . .\\n\\n  April 20, 1988\\n  Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

I have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced\\na seizure on November 3, 1992 at 6:45AM after eating Kellog\\'s Frosted\\nFlakes.  She is perfectly healthy, had never experienced anything like\\nthis before, and there is no history of seizures in either side of the\\nfamily.  All the tests (EEG, MRI, EKG) came out negative so the decision\\nwas made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again.\\n\\nWell, we were going along fine and the other morning, April 5, she had\\na bowl of another Kellog\\'s frosted kind of cereal, Fruit Loops (I am\\nembarrassed to admit that I even bought that junk but every once\\nin a while...) So I pour it in her bowl and think \"Oh, oh, this is the\\nsame kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure.\"  Ten \\nminutes later she had a full blown seizures. This was her first exposure\\nto a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure.\\n\\nWhen I mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for\\nthe seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea.  Now\\nafter this second episode, so similar in nature to the first, even\\nhe is scratching his head.  Once again her EEG looks normal which I\\nunderstand can happen even when a person has a seizure.\\n\\nOnce again we are waiting. I have been thinking that it would be good\\nto get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any\\nexperience with this kind of thing.  I know that members of the medical\\ncommunity are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and\\nfoods play in our general health and well-being.  Anyway, as you can\\nguess, I am worried sick about this, and would appreciate any ideas\\nanyone out there has.

(Stay close to \\n          your home bathroom.) \\n               4th day: Eat all the UN-salted nuts (NO peanuts) and \\n          dried fruit you want, preferably raisins and almonds (ALMONDS \\n          CONTAIN LAETRILE.). \\n               5th day: ONE GALLON OF LEMONADE.  Squeeze the juice from \\n          two lemons into a gallon of water (preferably distilled), and \\n          add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally-made honey, (NO sugar).  \\n          Drink one glass per hour.\\n          [EVERYone, including healthy people, should do this one day \\n          every week, preceded by a large glass of prune juice WITH \\n          PULP.] \\n               6th day: Same as 5th day. \\n               7th day: Same as 6th day. \\n               All 7 days, eat ONLY the foods listed above for each \\n          day, along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements, \\n          plus as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \\n\\n          (2) THE GRAPE DIET. \\n               Eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours, 8 AM to \\n          8 PM, every day for six days.  Eat NOTHING else during the \\n          six days, but drink as much DISTILLED WATER as you want. \\n      \\n          (3) APPLE CIDER VINEGAR.\\n               Mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar (NOT apple \\n          cider \"flavored\" vinegar.  Regular vinegar is HARMFUL.) in a \\n          glass of water (preferably distilled) and drink all of it.  \\n          Do this 3 or 4 times per day, for 3 weeks; then stop for a \\n          week.  Repeat if desired.  Do this along with a normal \\n          healthy diet of natural foods.  This remedy is especially \\n          effective against those types of cancer that resemble a \\n          FUNGUS, as well as against other kinds of fungus infections. \\n        \\n          (4) THE SEA-SALT & SODA BATH.  [Please keep an OPEN MIND.]\\n               Fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level \\n          comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in.  \\n          Immerse yourself in it for a minute, and then completely \\n          dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of SUN-evaporated SEA-salt \\n          (regular salt won\\'t work.) and 1 pound of fresh baking-soda. \\n               Soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes, while exercising \\n          your fingers, toes, and limbs, turning sideways and onto your \\n          stomach, dunking your head, sitting up and laying back down, \\n          chomping your teeth together, etc.. \\n               Among other things, the SEA-salt & Soda Bath neutralizes \\n          the accumulated effects of X-rays, etc., as described in the \\n          book \"Born To Be Magnetic, Vol. 2\", by Frances Nixon, 1973. \\n               PRECAUTIONS: Only the ONE person using each bath should \\n          prepare it and drain it.\\n          For at least 30 minutes after taking the bath, stay away \\n          from, and even out of sight of, other people.  (Your greatly \\n          expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt \\n          other people\\'s fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at \\n          least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.  \\n          (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take \\n          a 2-Billion-bacteria \"Acidophilus\" capsule, which is also an \\n          EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \"A.I.D.S.\" \\n          (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the \\n          digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune \\n          system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal \\n          bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \"Lyme disease\".]\\n          Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder \\n          storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \"Major\" or \\n          \"Minor Periods\" as listed in the \"Solunar Tables\" published \\n          bimonthly in \"Field & Stream\" Magazine, (because of the \\n          measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields \\n          present at those times).\\n          Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year. \\n       \\n          (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES: \\n       \\n               For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the \\n               affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons \\n               per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for \\n               about 2 months. \\n        \\n               D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to \\n               perform NORMAL cell functions. \\n\\n               ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.  \\n               To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.  \\n               To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per \\n               day.\\n               [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.  \\n               IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer \\n               cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile \\n               into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is \\n               ALSO present in the digestive system.)] \\n\\n               ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include \\n               Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most \\n               people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A \\n               (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide \\n               Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up \\n               to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-\\n               toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime \\n               will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types), \\n               suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes, \\n               prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not \\n               cure herpes.  BHT MIGHT ALSO DO THESE THINGS AGAINST \\n               \"A.I.D.S.\", which is really a form of cancer similar to \\n               leukemia.]  (See the book \"Life Extension\", by Durk \\n               Pearson and Sandy Shaw.) \\n\\n               HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE.  Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3% \\n               hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably \\n               DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day, \\n               hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.  \\n               Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers \\n               several times per day.\\n               Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good \\n               daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants \\n               described above. \\n\\n               VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and \\n               much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA \\n               doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources. \\n\\n               Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell) \\n               NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on \\n               and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an \\n               aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-\\n               radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with \\n               daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH \\n               magnetic fields. \\n\\n               Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES \\n               can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well \\n               as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics \\n               Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos \\n               of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays! \\n\\n               INTERFERON tablets.\\n\\n               TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho). \\n           \\n               HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical \\n               problems (even drug addiction!). \\n\\n               50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure \\n               prostate trouble. \\n\\n               This list is NOT exhaustive. \\n\\n\\n          The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-\\n          DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent \\n          and cure many other medical problems including heart-\\n          diseases.  They are NOT too simple and inexpensive to work \\n          effectively. \\n\\n          Besides acting on a person biologically and chemically, these \\n          remedies, especially The 7-Day Fast and The Grape Diet, send \\n          a strong message to one\\'s subconscious mind, PROGRAMMING it \\n          to CURE the cancer. \\n\\n          In my opinion, if a person finds out that s/he has cancer, \\n          then s/he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies \\n          described above, in sequence (starting with The 7-Day Fast), \\n          BEFORE resorting to the UN-natural and expensive mutilations \\n          and agonies [POISON, BURN, and MUTILATE!] of orthodox cancer \\n          treatment [organi$ed-CRIME!]. \\n          \\n          \\n          DISCLAIMER: This list was compiled from unorthodox sources \\n          that have shown themselves to be reliable.  The compiler of \\n          this list is NOT a doctor of any kind, but is exercising his \\n          First Amendment Constitutional RIGHT of FREE SPEECH on the \\n          subjects of his choice. \\n\\n\\n          FOR MORE INFORMATION, contact Cancer Control Society, 2043 N. \\n          Berendo St., Los Angeles, CA  90027, and/or other organiza-\\n          tions listed in the \"Alternative Medicine\" and \"Holistic \\n          Medicine\" portions of the \"Health and Medical Organizations\" \\n          Section (Section 8) of the latest edition of the \"Encyclope-\\n          dia of Associations\" reference book in your local public or \\n          university library. \\n\\n\\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \\n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED. \\n\\n          \\n                                   Robert E.

For example, is the scope\\nin \"equivalent time\" or in \"real time\" sampling mode (equivalent time\\nbeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to\\nthe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope\\'s actual sampling\\nrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but\\nbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.\\n\\nIs the HP scope you\\'re using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz\\nsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front\\nend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for\\nequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really\\nonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single\\nsample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.\\n\\nSo, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get\\nuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for\\ngeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage for\\nlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability\\nof the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to\\nfall...\\n\\n-- \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n       Dave Medin\\t\\t\\tPhone:\\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\\n    SSD--Networking\\t\\t\\t\\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\\n    Intergraph Corp.\\n       M/S GD3004 \\t\\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\\t\\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\\n\\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\\n\\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\\n'},\n",

Jagr did not have a better season than\\n     Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of\\n     hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty\\n     plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.\\n\\n     Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice\\n     time per game and some measure of its \"quality\" (i.e., is the player put out\\n     in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up\\n     against the other team\\'s top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would\\n     much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious\\n     merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.\\n\\nThank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the\\nfact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you\\nthat I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/-\\ncomparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone\\nwould argue that Jagr\\'s higher +/- actually reflected better two-way\\nplay.\\n\\nIn my opinion, Francis\\'s low +/- is purely a result of him being asked\\nto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he\\ncan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team\\'s top center\\nis a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the\\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can\\'t even get\\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.\\n\\n(By the way, don\\'t get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy\\nfloater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like\\novertime of playoff games).\\n\\n--\\nRoland Dreier                                        dreier@math.berkeley.edu\\n'},\n",

But my point is that\\nit wasn\\'t Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I\\'m nit-picking and mincing words, go back\\nand read from where this thread started...\\n\\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan\\'s mind who suddenly\\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\\namazing, I\\'ll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we\\'ve got a *kick*\\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I\\'ll go watch him play\".  I think it was the latter.\\n\\n> Similar thing happened in L.A.   Before\\n>Gretzky\\'s arrival, about 12000 per game.  After, constant sellouts.

They\\'ve had MUCH better teams in their past history than\\n>they currently have, yet they didn\\'t draw as well then.\\n\\nI don\\'t think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don\\'t go to\\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\\nholders in LA don\\'t always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\\ninitial success following Gretzky\\'s arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \\n\\nWhether or not the Kings are a \\'winner\\' is debatable.  I claim that since\\nGretzky\\'s arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\\ndynasty...but that\\'s another story and included only because I don\\'t like\\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\\n\\n>I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend\\n>winning as the major drawing power.  \\n\\nFor the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it\\'s inevitable that the team\\nwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they\\nmake people around them better.\\n\\n>But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-)\\n\\nWell, at least we are in full agreement here!\\n\\n>This does not make Roger\\'s point any more valid, but the Jets aren\\'t\\n\\nSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn\\'t resist...>\\n\\n>getting a HUGE jump in productivity, yet they ARE getting a huge\\n>jump in attendance.  This is due to the emergence of Teemu Selanne.\\n>They have the 17th best record in hockey, it sure as hell isn\\'t because\\n>they are winning.\\n\\nYes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of\\nreasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people\\nshowing up at Winnipeg games.  It\\'s difficult to predict, but do you think\\nthat if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they\\nwill maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that\\ncase the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without\\nSelanne.\\n\\nI did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the \\nCFL...did you leave it out because you don\\'t know much about the CFL?  If \\nthat\\'s the case then fair enough, but if it isn\\'t the case then I\\'m curious\\nto hear your explanation.\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc)\\nBut my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecution\\nwe have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back from\\nthe dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman\\nor greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e.\\nemperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing\\nto do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human \\ntorches to light up his dinner party it wasn't because the believe in a \\nrisen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and\\ncannablism.

Some of the land was in fact given to the  \\nJews by the United Nations, quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab  \\nabsentee landlords.

Since,  however, I agree with those who  \\nclaim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West  \\nbank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion  \\nto attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis  \\npromptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining  \\npossession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats  \\nnational suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it  \\nis that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them  \\nand the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs  \\ncontinues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they  \\ncan launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West  \\nBank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is  \\nthe small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West  \\nBank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even  \\nleftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't  \\ngoing to propose giving up Jerusalem. If he did, he'd get run out of town  \\non a rail.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tchag sameach!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tjeff\\n\"},\n",

Scum has no guilt or freedom to\\nchoose anything.  Griffen does.  God did not make scum when he made Griffen.\\nHe made a precious person and this person chose to do wrong.  The same goes\\nfor Dr. Gunn.\\n\\n: But if you are to examine it more closely, Griffen would have preferred that\\n: these children were born -- yet AFTER their birth, did Griffen have any \\n: assistance to offer them?  Did Griffen intend to support them, educate them,\\n: raise them up to be useful citizens?  Did he have any intent whatsoever\\n: to help these children after birth?\\n: \\n\\nHere\\'s the real problem.  Americans have become so insensitive to the needs\\nof others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see\\nstraight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious\\nmoral decisions based on reality.\\n\\nIf a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not\\nconsidered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has\\nfled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned\\naway from his responsibility to his wife and child.\\n\\nHowever, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden,\\nshe is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman\\nsuffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life.\\nWhen the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed\\nout, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that\\nhe wishes he could trade places with his child.\\n\\nThs root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, \"My\\nfeelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung.\"\\nAnd when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.\\nIt\\'s the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his\\ndemons for all of eternity.  Let any one of us unrepentant into heaven, and\\nwe\\'ll ruin it the first chance we get.\\n\\n: Now, I don\\'t really know the answer to these questions, but I\\'ve got a real\\n: good guess.\\n: \\n\\nAnd, it\\'s probably right.\\n\\n: And I wouldn\\'t call *that* \\'benevolent\\', either.\\n: \\n\\nIt is a move in the right direction.  As it is now, we don\\'t see our\\nresponsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The media\\nbacks us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The only\\n\"responsibility\" that sells in the marketplace is that which is just\\nenough to make us \"feel responsible\" without showing anything that\\nmight show us our own true irresponsibility.  We want to \"feel\" like\\ngood people, but we want nothing with *being* good people.  Just give\\nme the freedom to say \"I\\'m good\", and the rest of the world can burn.\\nRape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where\\npoor old folks rot until they\\'re dead.  I\\'ll hate my brother and sister\\nif I wish and I\\'ll cheat on my wife or husband.  Screw the government,\\nbecause it screws me, and don\\'t talk to me about giving to the church\\nbecause church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites.\\nBut, I\\'m a good person.  At least I admit what I do.  At least I love\\nmyself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not that\\na man lay down his life for his brother...That sounds too \"christian\".\\n\\nAt the root, this is the substance of what hell is made of.\\n\\nWe\\'ve become a self indulgant, backslidden society no longer responsible\\nto our children, to our parents, to our families, to our government, or\\nto our God.  This is the root behind justification of every evil, of every\\ncorruption in government, of every slanderous remark, of every lie, and\\nof every murder.  Society cannot continue to live like this long.  it will\\nhave to destroy itsself soon, and perhaps in the end, that will be the\\nbiggest blessing this world can hope to see.\\n\\nWhy do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around?\\n\\n--\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t\"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...\\n\\t We want prevention, not merely punishment.\\n\\t We must reach the root of the evil...\\n\\t It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt\\n\\t from the dreadful deed...\\n\\t No mater what the motive, love of ease,\\n\\t\\tor a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent,\\n\\t\\tthe woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed...\\n\\t but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her\\n\\t\\tto the desperation which impelled her to the crime.\"\\n\\n\\t\\t- Susan B.

Scott) writes:\\n>\\n> [ ... picking nits over tanks firing the main gun or not deleted ...]\\n> \\n\\nI think the point is being missed - that it is apparantly acceptable for\\nBig Government (Big Brother?) to use TANKS to control the people, as\\nlong as they don\\'t use the BIG GUN (but everything else is allright...).\\n\\nTanks deployed against civilians, let alone FIRING on them with crew\\nserved weaponry (a .50 Heavy Machine Gun is crew-served) is something\\nboth our press and government howl about instantly when done in some\\nother country.  Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time\\nLIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind\\nthe tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle\\nor pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And \"snipers\"\\ntoo often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.\\n\\nI don\\'t know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but\\nthe idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that\\npretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels\\nit is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even\\nviolent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally\\nout of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war\\non its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,\\ngovernment of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the \\'lords\\' and other elites\\nwho want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn\\'t feel the\\nneed to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military\\nboot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced\\nthat it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances\\nredressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that\\nwill exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been\\nunresponsive or such acts wouldn\\'t be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse\\nto open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.\\nIts the old \\'might makes right\\' philosophy that is the hallmark of a\\ngovernment going rogue:  They don\\'t like it? Tough. We will simply\\nsquash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances\\nin other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too\\ninconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them\\nin the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...\\n\\nAnd these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things\\nso that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are\\nthan expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn\\'t\\nPROGRESSIVE or doesn\\'t fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...\\n\\nUnbelievable.\\n\\nAnd I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation,\\nthat it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun\\ninto a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many\\nexplosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000\\npound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall,\\nand some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources\\nof buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as\\ngunfire, including 50\\'s tacking away, it would not stand out that much,\\nand could be explained by \"musta been a gas leak... \".  I think it could be\\ndone and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is\\nnot like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning\\nand firing, you know.  THAT would stand out, and be pretty impossible\\nto cover up.\\n\\n>--John L.

In this configuration, X windows\\napplications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  However, if he opens up a\\nsecond xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window,\\ngiving the error: Unable to load ISO 8859-1 font.\\n\\n   The only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial\\none references a different name in the Xsession file, with prettier\\ncolours and other slight changes.  Further investigation shows that only\\nopening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, ALL\\nX applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the\\ncommand line in either window.  If I start the xterm with a different\\nfont (using the -fn option), no problems.  It would seem that the\\ndefault xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose\\nall of its fonts.  Note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the\\nfonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font\\ndirectories/hash-tables.\\n\\n   Other than rewriting the XTerm app-defaults file to use a different\\nfont and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?\\n\\nMore info:  This is the most recent MIPS workstation (R4000 I believe),\\n       with the most current operating system and running X11R5.\\n       It is not mwm's fault, as the same problems occur under twm, etc.\\n\"},\n",

This entry specifies the number of\\npels-per-em at which Windows will render TrueType fonts as outline fonts\\ninstead of as bitmap fonts.  The default is 256.  I've generally been able\\nto get fonts to work by setting OutlineThreshold=160.  Depending on your\\nprinter resolution and the point size you are using, you may need a\\ndifferent value.\\n\\nThe Windows Resource Kit warns against going above 300.

I had great difficulty\\nwith that duty.  I used to pray earnestly in the courthouse\\nbathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the couples\\nwould come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and\\ndivine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didn\\'t realize\\nthat marriage is God\\'s institution, not the state\\'s.  Gradually,\\nhowever, I came to conclude that because I was acting in a\\nstrictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both\\nthe state and the expectations of the couples involved, I was\\nreally conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no\\ngreater moral or religious implications than if I had been\\nconducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony,\\nto \"please hurry it up\" may have helped me to this conclusion). \\n\\n     I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp\\ndistinction between marriage before God, and \"marriage\" before\\nthe state, until I had to deal with my own divorce.

I don\\'t care if there are going to\\nreform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe\\nit when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up,\\njust looking, you don\\'t even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10)\\nsalesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you,\\nand try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards.\\nService is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but\\nthey tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of\\nwork/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care\\nof this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took\\nit to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn\\'t have been.\\n\\n1988 Dodge Shadow ES\\n\\nThese were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.\\n\\nEngine \\n4 Alternators\\nRear Suspension Torsion Bar\\n2 Water pumps\\n5 thermostats\\nHall effect sensor\\nMain computer\\n4 Batteries\\n\\nThese were rebuilt/repaired\\n\\nRadiator\\nAutomatic Transmission\\nPower Steering\\n\\n\\nThose are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For\\nabout a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it\\'s a good car, I\\njust can\\'t find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I\\ntraded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I\\njust stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000\\nworth of repairs over it\\'s lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite\\nme.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are\\ngoing to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the\\nhell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.\\n\\nYou can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but\\nJapanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I\\nfeel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler\\nproduct again, no way.  I don\\'t care how good the LH cars look good, and I\\nwill admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM\\nisn\\'t much better, thank god, they don\\'t control Saturn, like they do\\ntheir divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.  \\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a\\nhawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car\\nis really good, until it has proved itself to me.\\n\\nBut since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because\\nI used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good\\nthing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were\\nthey moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend\\nalways thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.\\n\\nAnd although there are alot of people who don\\'t like Consumers Reports, I\\nwill use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink\\nwith the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the\\nshadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the\\nchrysler\\'s rate a better than average, I think the best one is just\\naverage.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH\\'s.  You\\ncan find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched\\nthe Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal\\nof information about this company, just because it is a new american\\ncompany and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for\\ngood reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of\\nany established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I\\nthink this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in\\nToyota said and I quote, \"We are watching them very closely.\"  Come on,\\neverybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been\\nkicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make\\na good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to\\nset in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They\\nare still struggling because they haven\\'t learned yet.  They have the\\nability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date,\\nbut their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.

But you\\'ve picked the wrong topic if you think a few\\nrigged \"quotations\" can sustain the legend and lie of the Deir\\nYassin \"massacre.\"\\n\\nYou have a lot to learn when it comes to historical methodology.\\nAt the most basic level, you should know that there is a big\\ndifference between weighing evidence fairly and merely finding\\n\"quotations\" that support your preset opinions.\\n\\nIf you have studied the history of Israel at all you must know that\\nmany of the sources of your \"quotations\" have an axe to grind, and\\ntherefore you must be very careful about whom you \"quote.\"  For\\nexample, Meir Pa\\'il, whom you cite, was indeed a general, a scholar,\\nand a war hero.  But that doesn\\'t mean everything that comes out of\\nhis mouth is gold.  In fact (and here your lack of experience\\nshows), Pa\\'il is such a fanatic, embittered leftist that much of his\\nanti-Israel blathering (forget about anti-Irgun blathering) would be\\nconsidered something like treason in non-Israel contexts.  But of\\ncourse you don\\'t consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy\\n\"quotation\" that you can use to attack Israel.\\n\\nBenny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a \"scholar\"\\nwhen he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don\\'t be fooled.\\nIt\\'s just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an\\nattack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at\\nthe section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence,\\nyou will see his \"indictment\" to be pure hot air.  And this is the\\nBEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning\\nevidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as\\n\"scholarly,\" he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see\\nthat his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.\\n\\nThe Deir Yassin \"massacre\" never took place as the propagandists\\ntell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila \"massacres.\" Do you get\\nthe feeling people like to blame the Jews for \"massacres,\" even if\\nthey have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews\\nlike to do it, for reasons of their own.\\n\\nPlease, don\\'t confuse any of you Deir Yassin \"massacre\" stuff\\nwith facts or scholarship.  You should stick to Begin\\'s version\\nunless you find something serious to contradict it.\\n\\nVic\\n'},\n",

If\\nOlerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an\\nextra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold\\nat third.  Thus Olerud\\'s doubles have more advancement value than\\nAlomar\\'s.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a\\ndouble.)\\n\\nAnother reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that\\nthe runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  No\\nteam in the 1950\\'s ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players\\nthan others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well\\nin the 1950\\'s for all teams.  \\n\\nBill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.

For example, incorrect\\nEnglish constructs such as \"its raining\" or \"it\\'s window id\" annoy me.\\nHowever, there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way\\nthings really are in the world. Indeed, the fact that X won out over NeWS\\nwas really down to popular opinion (I know, we all think it\\'s(!) technically\\nsuperior as well!).\\n\\nOn a related topic, who is to say that \"color\" is more or less correct\\nthan \"colour\" - being Irish, and hence using English English as opposed\\nto American English, I always use the latter except, of course, for API\\nterms such as \"XAllocColor\" and \"colormap\".\\n\\nIn a world that uses the term \"Windows\" to refer to Microsoft Windows,\\nperhaps the time has come to accept \"X Windows\" as a valid term for X.\\nI think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than, say,\\n\"the X Window System\" and, let\\'s face it, almost everyone uses it.\\nUltimately, we all need product sales to more than just X-literate\\npeople. In this respect, product recognition is important and a short,\\nsnappy, descriptive title (\"X\" is positively obscure) will help\\nwhen dealing with the average punter (it\\'s sad - I thought I was a\\nsoftware engineer!). Indeed it is unfortunate that X did not become\\npopularly known as Windows and let MS worry about whether it should\\nbe called \"Microsoft Windows\" or \"the Microsoft Window System\" or\\nhow about just plain \"Microsoft\"!\\n\\nTo summarise (or should that be \"summarize\") the point of this message:\\nI think there are far more pressing issues facing the X community than\\nworrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system\\n(or should that be \"windowing system\"). Whatever gets recognised is\\nfine by me. I agree that one should be careful in interpreting what\\ntrade papers say. However, I would be reluctant to come to this\\nconclusion purely on the basis of how they name the X Window System.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tGerard O\\'Driscoll (gerard.odriscoll@dps.co.uk)\\n\\t\\t\\tDu Pont Pixel Systems Ltd.\\n'},\n",

It was the religion of the great Persian\\nEmpire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ\\nwas born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three\\nZoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,\\nJews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the\\nZoroastrian prophet.\\n\\n   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are \\na miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a\\npeople is very much on their minds.\\n\\n   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance\\nof the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed\\nby nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause\\ntheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.\\n\\n   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they\\nactually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children\\nbecome totally assimilated, they say, it\\'s their children - rather than\\nthe world at large - who will be the losers.\\n\\n   \"It\\'s important to have an identity,\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,\\na leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \"It\\'s important\\nfor everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.\\nYou don\\'t have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.\\nYou can fall back on your own identity.\"\\n\\n   For Zoroastrians, there\\'s much to be proud of.\\n\\n   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which\\nanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was\\nonly one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which\\ntranslates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.\\n\\n_Good vs. evil_\\n\\n   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with\\nthe good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for\\ngood, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences\\nsuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,\\nkindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of\\nmen and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.\\n\\n   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to\\nfollow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,\\nJoseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,\\ntraced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.\\n\\n   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a\\nstained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of\\nMount Hamilton, is \"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\"\\n\\n   So it\\'s not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,\\nwhere a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape\\npersecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;\\nthe overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.\\n\\n   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India\\nand Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from\\nIran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state\\nwhere others had no rights.\\n\\n   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \"good\\ndeeds\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,\\nthe recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because\\nManou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up\\ndowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple\\'s\\ndedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the\\nZoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.\\n\\n   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an\\nIranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples\\nin North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount\\nHamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,\\nand Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on\\nthis continent.\\n\\n   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the\\nproperty already had a large house that they have converted to a\\ncommunity center.\\n\\n   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet \\nZoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted \\nceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.\\n\\n   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-\\nin area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are \\nsometimes called \"fire worshippers,\" they actually consider fire just \\na symbol of God.  \"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the \\ncross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\" Bhujwala said.\\n\\n   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all\\nIranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of\\nthe season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With\\nZoroaster\\'s birthday just six days later, the combination of religious\\nand secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the\\nUnited States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.\\n\\n  For this year\\'s celebration of the prophet\\'s birthday, about 500 people\\ncame to worship and revel.\\n\\n   \"The good things in life are not forbidden,\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,\\na leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed\\nproved him right.\\n\\n   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood\\naround the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted\\nthanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking\\nsandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit\\nand nuts.\\n\\n   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \"People eat the\\nfruit,\" Tarapore said.  \"It\\'s a way to participate in the ceremony.\"\\n\\n_Santa Claus, sort of_\\n\\n   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white\\nhair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green\\nsymbolic of spring) and red.\\n\\n   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and\\nplayed a tambourine.\\n\\n   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \"This is all new for us, too,\"\\none told a visitor who asked what was going on.\\n\\n   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with\\nthe religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have\\nno procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their\\ncenturies of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu\\nking who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his\\npeople\\'s religion.\\n\\n   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the\\nSan Jose temple whenever he can.\\n\\n   \"When I first heard about this religion,\" he said, \"I thought, my God,\\nthis is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.\\n\\n   \"People who don\\'t have a tradition, something to lean on, what\\'s the\\ndifference with the lower animals?\"\\n\\n------------------------------------------------ end of article ---- \\n'},\n",

       "  'content': 'From: kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu (Dr Nancy\\'s Sweetie)\\nSubject: Re: Certainty and Arrogance\\nOrganization: Rowan College of New Jersey\\nLines: 122\\n\\nIn an earlier article, I explained that what many people find arrogant about\\nChristians is that some Christians profess absolute certianty about their\\nbeliefs and doctrines.  That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have\\nmade any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying\\nthat they are infallible.\\n\\nImpicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will\\nprobably agree.\\n\\nIn short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any\\npart of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning,\\nthen those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved,\\nthere is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing \"There\\nis no way out of the loop.\"\\n\\n\\nSomeone called `REXLEX\\' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but\\nhe did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase\\nSartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument\\nleads to relativism.\\n\\nAs I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false\\nbecause you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because\\nyou dislike them.  `REXLEX\\' wrote:\\n\\n>  I disagree with Dr Nancy\\'s Sweetie\\'s conclusion because if it is\\n> taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.\\n\\nHowever, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX\\' has\\nwritten does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does\\nnot like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThere were two sentences in `REXLEX\\'s post that seemed relevant to the\\npoint at hand:\\n\\n>  There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be\\n> experienced and it is verifiable.\\n\\nI do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I\\nhave, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don\\'t claim to\\nbe infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I\\ndo claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.\\n\\nHowever, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about\\nthem, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier\\narticle.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted\\nin very limited circumstances.\\n\\n\\n>  It is only because of God\\'s own revelation that we can be absolute\\n> about a thing.\\n\\nBut how far does that get you?  Once God\\'s revelation stops, and your own\\nreasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s suppose that our modern Bible translations include a\\nperfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said,\\nexactly, \"This is my body.\"\\n\\nWe\\'ll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely\\ntrue.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.\\n\\nAt the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the\\npossibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do\\nnot have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of\\nTran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn\\'t say.  We interpret this passage\\nusing our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know\\nthat our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This\\nis something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)\\n\\nWhy should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be\\nfallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?\\n\\nSo, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is\\nthat Jesus said \"This is my body.\"  Beyond that, once we start making up\\ndoctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we\\nget into trouble.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain\\nof.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they\\ncannot be certain.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know\\nthat human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not\\nbelieve we are infallible, any more than we do.\\n\\nWhen Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead\\nthem astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non-\\nChristians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is\\nhardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you\\nare either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\\nto cover them up.\\n\\nI think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what\\nthings we are only \"very confident\" of.  For example, we might say that we\\nknow our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But\\nother things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical\\nthinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are\\nvery confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.\\n\\nBut, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting\\nas if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.\\n\\n *\\n\\n`REXLEX\\' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by\\nFrancis Schaeffer.  I didn\\'t think very highly of it, but I think that\\nMr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody\\nelse might like it, though, so don\\'t let my opinion stop you from reading it.\\n\\nIf someone is interested in my opinion, I\\'d suggest _On Certainty_, by\\nLudwig Wittgenstein.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some\\n Wittgenstein, 60% of the postings would disappear.  (If they *understood*\\n some Wittgenstein, 98% would disappear. :-))\" -- Michael L Siemon\\n'},\n",

Can anybody help me out?\\n\\nThe problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators,\\nand these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately,\\nthe specification for XGrabKey doesn\\'t allow AnyModifier to be combined\\nwith other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:\\n\"Ctrl Any<Key>q\".\\n\\n>In ORA Vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says \"For information\\n>on how to specify translation tables see Vol. 4...\", this is so you\\n>know what to put for the XmNaccelerator resource.  If you go to\\n>Vol. 4 it says, \"Likewise, if a modifier is specified, there is\\n>nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. For\\n>example, the translation:\\n>\\tShift<Key>q:\\tquit()\\n>will take effect even if the Ctrl key is held down at the same time as\\n>the Shift key (and the q key).\\n\\nThis is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using\\nevent handlers instead of grabs; it\\'s not true for menu accelerators.  If\\nyou\\'re a Motif implementor, I\\'d suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics\\nchanged to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the\\ndocumentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user\\'s\\nexpectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as\\ntranslations.\\n\\n>Is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry?\\n\\nIf you mean \"menu accelerator\", no it\\'s not possible.  That\\'s according to\\nthe definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.\\n\\n>Keep in mind when answering this question that when using Motif you\\n>can\\'t use XtInstallAccelerators().\\n\\nI can\\'t think of a reason why not.\\n\\n>How can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of\\n>case?  What I want is Ctrl+O and Ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one\\n>menu entry.\\n\\nThere is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu\\naccelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators\\nresource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell\\'s\\naccelerators on itself and all of its descendants with\\nXtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).\\n\\nFor example,\\n\\n  applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  - exitPushbutton\\n\\n  *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O\\n  *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O\\n  *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q\\n  *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q\\n\\n  *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\\\\n\\\\\\n    Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\\\n\\\\\\n    Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\n\\nYou have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you\\ncan implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then\\nXtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.\\n\\nI tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I\\nused TeleUSE\\'s TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators\\non the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead\\nof asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I\\ndescribed above should work.\\n\\n-- Trevor Bourget (trevor@telesoft.com)\\n'},\n",

       "  'content': 'From: kkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu (Keith Keller)\\nSubject: Playoff pool, rules, entry form\\nOrganization: University of Pennsylvania, School of Arts and Sciences\\nLines: 39\\nNntp-Posting-Host: mail.sas.upenn.edu\\n\\nWell, the tentative rules, anyway.  And, of course, since the season is\\nnot entirely over, tentative entry form.  But who cares?  The real hockey\\nseason is starting!!!!!\\n\\nHere\\'s the deal:  You email (preferably) or post your predictions, AND the\\nnumber of games you think each series will go.  Each round will be\\nweighted, so that the Stanley Cup finals will be very important, but the\\nearly rounds will still be important.  Here is the scoring:\\n\\nPick 1st round winner, way off on games:  2 points\\nPick 1st round winner, within one game:   3 points\\nPick 1st round winner, pick # of games:   5 points\\n\\nPick 2nd round winner, way off on games:  3 points\\nPick 2nd round winner, within one game:   4 points\\nPick 2nd round winner, pick # of games:   6 points\\n\\nPick conference champ, way off on games:  5 points\\nPick conference champ, within one game:   6 points\\nPick conference champ, pick # of games:   9 points\\n\\nPick Stanley Cup champ, way off on games: 8 points\\nPick Stanley Cup champ, within one game:  10 points\\nPick Stanley Cup champ, pick # of games:  14 points\\nPick loser in 7, series goes 7:           2 points\\nPick loser in 7, series decided in Game 7, OT: 4 points\\n(these last two are sympathy points, probably won\\'t happen anyway)\\n\\nObviously, picking the Stanley Cup champion is important.  I will do some\\ntests to see if the format is fair, but probably I will be too lazy to\\nmodify it, so the scoring will probably be like this.  As for entry forms,\\nwell, this post is getting too long, so see next post. \\n\\n--\\n    Keith Keller\\t\\t\\t\\tLET\\'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLET\\'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\\n\\tkkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu\\t\\tIVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!\\n\\n            \"When I want your opinion, I\\'ll give it to you.\" \\n'},\n",

But the analysis\\nis quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on\\nwhich it is based so that others can verify it.  \\n\\nIt is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are\\nanimals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because\\nthose who performed the study did not \"blind\" themselves.  It is not\\nconsidered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already\\nare, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested,\\nthe control and test groups are treated alike.\\n\\nRussell\\n'},\n",

UK.\\nSupersedes: <19930322114724@mantis.co.uk>\\nLines: 632\\n\\nArchive-name: atheism/logic\\nAlt-atheism-archive-name: logic\\nLast-modified: 5 April 1993\\nVersion: 1.4\\n\\n                       Constructing a Logical Argument\\n\\nAlthough there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument\\nfound is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\\n\\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\\nargument.\\n\\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\\nthe right tool for the job.\\n\\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\\n\\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\\n\\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\\nthree stages.\\n\\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \\n\\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\\npremises.  If something doesn\\'t seem obvious to you, don\\'t be afraid to\\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you\\'re right, it is obvious\" when\\nyou\\'ve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\\n\\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\\n\\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \\nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \\nsometimes a little confusing.\\n\\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\\n\\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\\n or the Son of God.\"\\n\\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \\nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\\'ll\\ncome to those later.)\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\\n\\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\\nargument.\\n\\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\\nB\".  If we\\'re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\\nstatement is an argument.  If we\\'re trying to establish the truth of B, then\\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\\n\\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- This is an explanation.\\n\\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\\nconclusion is true.\\n\\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\\n\\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\\ncarefully.\\n\\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \\nFor example:\\n\\n   All insects have wings (premise)\\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\\n\\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\\'s premises are false. \\nIf the argument\\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \\nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\\n\\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\\nas in:\\n\\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\\n\\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \\n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\\n\\nPremise Conclusion Inference\\n   A        B        A=>B\\n----------------------------\\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\\n\\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\\n\\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclusion must be true.\\n\\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \\nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\\n\\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\\n\\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\\nconvincing.\\n\\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\\nexhaustive.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\\n\\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \\nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\\n\\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\\n\\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\\n\\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \\nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\\'s\\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\\n\\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\\nthe opponent\\'s particular circumstances.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\\notherwise when you\\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\\n\\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\\nthe opponent\\'s argument.\\n\\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \\nYou\\'re white.\"\\n\\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\\'s\\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\\n\\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \\nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\\n\\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\\nsuch flood occurred.\"\\n\\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\\nhowever.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\\n\\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \\ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \\nconclusion accepted.  For example:\\n\\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\\'t find me\\nguilty; I\\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\\n\\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\\n\\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\\n\\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\\n\\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\\n\\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\\n\\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\\n\\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\\nbetween:\\n\\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \\nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\\nspecific.  For example:\\n\\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\\ndislike atheists.\"\\n\\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\\n\\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\\n\\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\\ninsincere.\"\\n\\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\\n\\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\\nhasty generalization.\\n\\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\\n\\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\\ncured me of the headache.\"\\n\\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\\natheism for the same reasons.\"\\n\\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\\n\\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\\nconclusion reached.\\n\\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \\nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \\nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\\nfor the British Secret Services\\' official ban on homosexual employees. \\nAnother example is the classic:\\n\\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\\n\\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\\n\\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \\nquestion:\\n\\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\\n\\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\\nwhen they ask questions like:\\n\\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\\n\\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\\n\\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\\n\\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\\n\\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \\nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\\nwith that conclusion.\\n\\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\\n\\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nEQUIVOCATION\\n\\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\\n\\nAMPHIBOLY\\n\\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\\n\\nACCENT\\n\\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\\n\\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\\nand\\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\\n\\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\\n\\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\\n\\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\\n\\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\\n\\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\\n\\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\\n\\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\\n\\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\\neach item.  For example:\\n\\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\\n\\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\\nfirst event.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand we\\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\\n\\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Isn\\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\\'t the Bible also a form of\\nhistory?\"\\n\\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\\'t Islam a\\nform of Christianity?\"\\n\\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\\'t dogs a form of cat?\"\\n\\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\\na fallacy.\\n\\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\\nanything about B.\\n\\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\\n\\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\\nbecause it is old, or because \"that\\'s the way it\\'s always been.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\\n\\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\\nthan something else.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\\n\\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\\n\\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\\n\\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\\n\\nBIFURCATION\\n\\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\\nalternatives exist or can exist.\\n\\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\\nquestion.\\n\\nNON SEQUITUR\\n\\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\\n\\nRED HERRING\\n\\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\\'s attention is diverted away from the\\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\\n\\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\\n\\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\\n\\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\\n\\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\\n\\nSTRAW MAN\\n\\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\\'s position so that it\\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\\n\\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \\ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \\nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\\n\\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legislation:\\n\\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\\n\\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\\n Martin Luther King.\"\\n\\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\\n\\nTU QUOQUE\\n\\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\\n\\n\"You\\'re just being randomly abusive.\"\\n\"So?  You\\'ve been abusive too.\"\\n\\nÿ\\n'},\n",

Since we apparently\\ndon\\'t have the sensor base you folks have, they\\'re installing\\ncameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests\\nare going to be in the Santa Clara area I\\'m told), with the\\nvideo being piped into a command center they\\'re building\\nsomewhere in the East Bay.  I\\'m not sure if frame grabbers or\\ncheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large\\nmulti-colored status displays will show the various routes\\nusing different colors to represent the various average speeds\\nfor each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front\\nof the status \\'wall\\', and will relay continuous verbal traffic\\nstatus to those who want to receive it.  They\\'re apparently also\\nlooking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to\\nproviding continuous audio from this system.\\n\\nIn the mean time, they\\'ll set up large incandescent display\\nboards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data\\non traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the\\nsystem is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it\\nwill be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is\\nsimilarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read\\n\"cheap\").\\n\\nWe also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP\\naudio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal\\nreports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle\\nreceivers like the \\'Auto Talk\\' that the information coming next is\\napplicable to a given area.  In LA, they\\'re probably using some\\nother TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your\\nstereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station\\njumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.\\nI believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle\\nreceivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly\\nfees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers\\ndon\\'t have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely\\ntrue), they likely have no investment in keeping the system\\nup and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You\\nmay have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing\\nmore, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)\\n\\nI think we\\'d all be interested in a summary post if you get more\\ninfo on how the LA system is networked and paid for.\\n\\nCheers,\\nAlan\\n<acooney@netcom.com>\\n\\n'},\n",

I strongly suspect that it\\'s a compressed\\nformat - if so, then t might not be possible for me to strip out the\\noffending header.\\n\\n (2) Are there any UNIX packages that read and recognize HRF?

Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  \\nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \\nPackard Scanners.  \\n\\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \\n(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \\nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \\n\\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \\nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\\n\\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The \\nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were \\nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \\nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn\\'t think it converted \\ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \\ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \\nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \\ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \\nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \\n\\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \\nprocessor formats.  Also any images that were captured can be stored in a \\nseperate TIFF or PCX file format.\\n\\nI was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \\nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \\nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \\nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \\nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \\nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \\ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \\nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \\nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \\ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \\nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \\nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \\nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \\neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \\n(3). \\n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \\nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \\nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \\npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \\nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \\n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \\nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \\nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \\ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \\npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \\nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \\n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \\n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \\nwas initiated. \\n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \\nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \\ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \\n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \\nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \\nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \\nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \\na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \\nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \\ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \\n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \\n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \\nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \\n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \\nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \\n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \\n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \\nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \\nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \\nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \\nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \\nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \\nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \\n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \\npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \\nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \\n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \\noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \\npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \\nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \\nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \\ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \\nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \\nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \\nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \\n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \\nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \\nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \\ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \\ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \\nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \\nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \\nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \\nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \\none patient 38 days after illness onset. \\n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \\nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \\n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \\nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \\nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \\nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \\n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \\nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \\n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \\nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \\nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \\nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \\n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \\n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \\nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \\nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \\nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \\nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \\n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \\nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \\n\\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \\nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \\nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \\nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \\nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children\\'s Hospital and \\nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \\nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has since \\nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \\ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \\nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \\nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \\nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \\nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \\nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \\nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \\nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \\n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \\nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \\nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \\n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \\nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \\ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \\ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \\nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \\n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \\noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \\nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \\nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \\n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \\npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \\nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \\nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \\nhealth action to prevent further cases. \\n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \\ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \\nDepartment of Agriculture\\'s Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \\ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \\nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \\nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \\npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \\nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \\ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \\nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \\nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \\nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \\nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \\n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \\n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \\nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \\nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \\noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \\nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \\ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \\ncoli O157:H7. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Long-term use of \\nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \\noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \\ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \\nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \\nCDC\\'s 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \\nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \\ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \\nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \\nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \\n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \\ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \\nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \\nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \\nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \\ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \\nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \\ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \\nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \\nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \\nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \\nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \\nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \\nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \\nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \\nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \\n(3). \\n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \\nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \\nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \\nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \\nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \\nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan \\nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \\nIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was \\nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \\nrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \\nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). \\n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \\naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \\nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although \\nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \\namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \\n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \\nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \\nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \\naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \\n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \\nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \\nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \\n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \\n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \\ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \\nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \\nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \\n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \\n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\\n49.6). \\n\\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \\nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \\nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \\ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \\nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \\nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \\nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \\nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \\nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \\n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \\nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \\nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \\nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \\nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \\ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \\n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \\nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \\nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \\nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \\nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \\nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \\nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \\nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \\n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \\npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \\ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \\n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \\nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \\nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \\ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \\nenforcing laws that restrict minors\\' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \\ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \\nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \\nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \\ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

It uses freon jets for\\nsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie\\nduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much\\ncontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also\\nneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and\\nflip the payload around to look at the Sun.\\n\\nWe have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I\\'m speaking\\nonly from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how\\nmuch freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have\\nextra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.\\n\\nThis should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas \\nquantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and I\\'ll try to get you\\nin touch with our ground crew people.\\n\\nCheers,\\nCraig\\n\\n--\\nDON\\'T DRINK SOAP! DILUTE DILUTE! OK!\\n'},\n",

I think\\nwe\\'ll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is\\nno \"option\" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:\\nthere is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full\\n\\'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).\\nAnd there is the full \\'040 which you get when you order anything other\\nthan the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one\\nof the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be\\ngetting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn\\'t\\nbe able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.\\nIt\\'s not an \"option.\"\\n    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s\\nthinking that there is an optional FPU, the \\'040 class chip cannot\\nrecognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for\\na FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or\\nsomething like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to\\nreplace the LC040 with a full \\'040. And if you have a C610, you will not\\nneed to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the LC040 with the\\nfull \\'040, but if you have a 4/80 C650 you do need to have a heat sink.\\n\\n-Hades\\n\\n'},\n",

       "  'content': 'From: JEK@cu.nih.gov\\nSubject: When are two people married\\nLines: 128\\n\\nLISTOWNER: I have sent this to Mr Anderson privately. Post it only\\nif you think it of general interest.\\n\\nHere is a copy of something I wrote for another list. You may\\nfind it relevant.\\n\\nA listmember asks:\\n\\n > What makes common-law marriages wrong?\\n\\nA common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There is\\nnothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by\\na preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish\\npriests have never had any connection with weddings.\\n\\nThere is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the\\nclergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in the\\nWest) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage,\\nand that the clergyman is there only as a witness.\\n\\nHOWEVER!\\n\\nThe essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Two\\npersons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound\\nthemselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife,\\nforsaking all others, till death do them part.\\n\\n      The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who\\nis married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public\\nceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may be\\nclear about whether a commitment has been made.\\n\\nSuppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows,\\netc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to live\\ntogether.\\n      After a year or so, the man says to the woman: Hey, honey, it\\nwas great while it lasted, but I think it\\'s time to move on.\\n      She says: What are you talking about?\\n      He says: I am leaving you and looking for someone prettier and\\nyounger.\\n      She says: But you can\\'t. We are married!\\n      He says: What are you talking about? We never got married.\\n      She says: I remember distinctly what you said to me the night\\nwe first made love. You said: \"My love for you is as deep as the\\nocean, as eternal as the stars. As long as I live, I am yours,\\nutterly and completely. When I lie on my deathbed, my last feeble\\nbreath will utter your name. My...\"\\n      He says: Oh that! That was just rhetoric. Just poetry. When a\\nman is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of silly\\nthings like that. You mustn\\'t take them literally.\\n\\nAnd that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is\\na matter of public record.\\n      The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among other\\nthings) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral advice\\nabout his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married\\nto whom, if anybody, and vice versa.\\n      The State insists on it, since the state has a concern with\\nproperty rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs to\\nknow who has made what commitments to whom.\\n      Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they don\\'t\\nwant their daughters seduced and abandoned.\\n      Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to make\\nsure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment,\\nor just \"poetry.\"\\n      And persons making vows themselves insist on making them\\nformally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their own\\nminds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselves\\nthat this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.\\n\\n      Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the\\nmarriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, when\\nChristians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and\\nrecord the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it is\\nimpossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in order\\nto make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching\\nabout marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be married\\nin a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriage\\nvow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for much\\nthe same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they\\ndraw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedly\\nused in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it.\\nTry to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find that\\nthe probate judge\\'s interpretation of them is not at all what you\\nintended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debates\\nabout whether \"You are my main squeeze\" and \"I am here for the long\\nhaul\" do in fact cover the same territory as \"forsaking all others\"\\nand \"till death do us part.\"\\n\\n      This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topic\\nthat hasn\\'t?) One listmember was asking, \"If a couple love each\\nother and are living together, isn\\'t that marriage in the eyes of\\nGod?\" Eventually someone asked, \"In that case, what is their status\\nif they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce?\\nAre they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk\\nout on? \" The original questioner said: \"Good grief, I never thought\\nof that!\" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that\\nsomeone who says, \"We don\\'t need a piece of paper or a ceremony in\\nfront of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each\\nother,\" is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of\\nmarriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of\\nbother.\\n\\nAt this point someone may say, \"None of this applies to me and my\\nmate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong\\ncommitment, \\'for better or worse, forsaking all others, till death\\nus do part.\\' So in our case, no ceremony is needed.\"\\n     To this my reply would be: The reason for requiring a driver\\'s\\nlicense is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong in\\nitself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existence\\nof dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is an\\nobvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the\\nnumber of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightly\\nmakes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positive\\nmoral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter\\nhow much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.\\n\\nBack to the original question. We have a listmember who knows a\\ncouple who have been living together for around 20 years. He asks:\\nAt what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? I\\nanswer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely and\\nexplicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, for\\nbetter or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have accepted\\nsuch an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing to\\ndeclare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace?\\n\\n Yours,\\n James Kiefer\\n'},\n",

He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It\\nisn\\'t a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for\\na persuasive argument.   Read Jesus\\'s own reply to your\\nquestion.\\n\\nJesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason\\nwhy Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with\\nhis punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that\\nwe would \"stop doubting and believe\" (John 21:27).  The fact\\nthat Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise\\nfrom the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.\\nWithout this obvious point, I would have no hope\\nand my faith would be vanity.\\n\\nWhy did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus\\nsays why in John 15:18-25.   That\\'s no mystery either.  \"The\\nworld hates him without reason.\"  It is a direct proclamation\\nof how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we\\nneed a Saviour.\\n\\nAnd why can\\'t you, Brian K., accept this?  How can you?  \"The\\nworld cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows\\nhim.\"  (John 14:17).   The animosity and the lack of knowledge\\nthat comes out in your twistings of Robert\\'s daily verses is\\nvery convincing testimony of the truth of John 14:17 and 16:25.\\nI pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of\\nknowledge. I am not perfect either.  But regardless of that, I thank\\nGod that Jesus revealed himself to me, without whom I\\'d also be\\nbumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very\\nPerson who created me and who loves me.\\n'},\n",

Shipping\\n|> to Virginia from Cleveland was around $20 for 12 pounds, and C.O.D.\\n|> was $8.00, as opposed to $4.50 for UPS.\\n\\nI'll third the opinion about this outfit/franchise. Now, when I\\nbuy over the net and pick up the shipping costs, I'll specify that I\\nonly pick up the normal UPS charges (as if delivered directly to\\nUPS), as I've been burned by $10 shipping charges for a $2.49 pkg.\\nI will never use a mailing service unless I don't have the\\nright box and the buyer needs whatever IMMEDIATELY. I'll also\\ntell the person, if they agreed to pick up shipping, what is going on.\\n\\nOther things to watch out for/consider:\\n\\n\\tThe rates are $5 to $30 higher than UPS direct.\\n\\n\\tFor a non-UPS (truck) package, they quoted a rate\\n\\tof $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the\\n\\tsame weight! RPS (a trucking package company, in many\\n\\tcities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox\\n\\toperator told me I was not telling the truth about\\n\\tcompetitors' rates, said RPS was unreliable (I've used them\\n\\tbefore with NO problems), etc. Right.\\n\\n\\tA COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local\\n\\tMailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the\\n\\tremade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the\\n\\tUPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)\\n\\n\\tFor packages over $100, they charge you about double over\\n\\twhat UPS charges them for insurance. I've never had\\n\\ta claim, but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?)\\n\\thave told horror stories about them...\\n\\n\\tAll package traces have to be done through Mailbox by\\n\\tMailbox.\\n\\n\\tOur local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I\\n\\tasked him why their rates were stratospheric compared\\n\\tto direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...\\n\\n\\tTheir UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex's economy\\n\\tair rate, and Fed Ex will pick up!\\n\\n\\tUPS will pick up for a $5 charge in most areas!\\n\\t\\n-- \\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n       Dave Medin\\t\\t\\tPhone:\\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\\n    SSD--Networking\\t\\t\\t\\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\\n    Intergraph Corp.\\n       M/S GD3004 \\t\\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\\t\\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\\n\\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******\\n\\n * The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)\\n\"},\n",

He \\npaints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an \\nintolerant medical establishment, but I have no basis from which to judge \\nhis claims.  Two weeks ago, however, I read that the NIH\\'s Department of \\nAlternative Medicine has decided to focus their attention on Burzynski\\'s \\nwork.
